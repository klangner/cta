      In patients with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, what is the response rate to combined
      Oxaliplatin (ELOXATIN®) and Gemcitabine chemotherapy?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxaliplatin (ELOXATIN®) is an organoplatinum complex which exerts its cytotoxic effect
      chiefly through inhibition of tumoral DNA synthesis and repair, leading to cellular
      apoptosis. The antiproliferative activity of oxaliplatin has been shown to approximate that
      of cisplatin or carboplatin in different tumor types.

      This is a phase II clinical trial of Oxaliplatin (ELOXATIN®) plus gemcitabine as first or
      secondline chemotherapy for patients with malignant pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma. This
      study aims to determine the objective tumor response rate for Oxaliplatin plus gemcitabine
      given every 14 days in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma and/or malignant
      peritoneal mesothelioma who have no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen. A total of 29
      patients are expected to be enrolled in the study, each with a participation duration of 6
      months.

      Patients will be screened using standard health care assessments and tests. All of these
      tests must be done within 4 weeks before patients begin treatment. Patients who are deemed
      eligible will start the treatment cycle, defined as an interval of 14 days, and comprising
      of treatment with Gemcitabine followed immediately by Oxaliplatin. The study drugs will be
      administered in the following manner: Gemcitabine, at 1000 mg/m² IV infusion over 90
      minutes, then Oxaliplatin, at 100 mg/m² IV infusion over 2 hours.

      In the absence of specific indications for discontinuation of study drugs, patients will
      routinely be offered 6 cycles of therapy. Further cycles may be given if in the opinion of
      the investigator this is in the patient's best interest.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed malignant pleural or peritoneal
             mesothelioma epithelial, sarcomatoid, or mixed subtype, not amenable to curative
             treatment with surgery. Patients with pleural mesothelioma will be clinically staged
             using the IMTG TNM staging criteria (see Protocol Attachment 1). Note that there is
             no staging system for peritoneal mesothelioma and those patients will only be
             followed for survival. Patients may be entered based on local pathology.

          -  Disease status must be that of measurable disease as defined by modified SWOG
             criteria.

               -  Measurable disease: The presence of at least one measurable lesion. If only one
                  lesion is present, the neoplastic nature of the disease site should be confirmed
                  by histology (see Section 3.8.1.2).

               -  Measurable lesions: Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one
                  dimension with the longest diameter ≥20 mm using conventional techniques or ≥10
                  mm using spiral CT scans. At least one level must have one rind measurement ≥15
                  mm.

          -  CT (specifically spiral CT) scans and MRT are the preferred methods of measurement.

          -  Clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable when they are
             superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).

          -  For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler
             to estimate the size of the lesion is required.

        NOTE:  Neither pleural effusions nor positive bone scans are considered measurable.

          -  Patients may have undergone pleurodesis. If pleurodesis was performed, there must be
             at least a 2-week delay before Oxaliplatin or gemcitabine is administered. If the
             original CT scan occurred prior to the pleurodesis, an additional CT scan is required
             2 weeks or longer after the pleurodesis, which will then be considered the baseline
             scan.

        NOTE:  For patients with clinically significant pleural effusions or ascites,
        consideration should be given to draining the fluid.

          -  Performance status of 0, 1 or 2 on ECOG Performance Status Scale (after any
             palliative measures including pleural drainage have occurred). See Protocol
             Attachment 2.

          -  Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than one previous regimen of systemic chemotherapy. Prior intracavitary
             cytotoxic drugs will count as a prior regimen, unless given for the purpose of
             pleurodesis. Immunomodulators will not be regarded as chemotherapy. Prior systemic
             treatment with pemetrexed plus a platinum compound will not be a contraindication for
             gemcitabine-oxaliplatin.

          -  Prior radiation therapy to the target lesion, unless the lesion is clearly
             progressing and the interval between the most recent radiation therapy and enrollment
             is at least 4 weeks.

          -  Active infection (at the discretion of the investigator).

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding.

          -  Serious concomitant systemic disorders (including oncologic emergencies) incompatible
             with the study (at the discretion of the investigator).

          -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin
             cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix are not to be registered.   Patients who
             are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they have completed
             therapy and are considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse.

          -  Use of any investigational agent within 4 weeks before enrollment into the study.

          -  Disease which cannot be radiologically imaged.
