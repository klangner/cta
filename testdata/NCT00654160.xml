      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of irinotecan when
      given together with fluorouracil and leucovorin in treating patients with advanced
      gastrointestinal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan hydrochloride in FOLFIRI for each
           respective UGT1A1 TA indel genotype grouping (group 1 [7/7, 7/8, 8/8], group 2 [6/7,
           5/7, 5/8 ,6/8], and group 3 [6/6, 5/6, 5/5]).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the molecular basis of toxicity, other than UGT1A1 variants, in
           FOLFIRI-treated cancer patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacodynamic molecular profiles of cell signaling pathways associated
           with the development and severity of early and late specific toxicities in cancer
           patients treated with FOLFIRI.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of irinotecan hydrochloride. Patients are
      stratified according to genotype of UGT1A1 TA indel.

        -  Group 1 ( TA genotype 7/7, 7/8, 8/8): Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over
           90 minutes and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV bolus
           over 5 minutes followed by IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1-3.

        -  Group 2 (TA genotype 6/7, 6/7, 5/8, 6/8): Patients receive treatment as in group 1 with
           a higher initial dose of irinotecan hydrochloride.

        -  Group 3 (TA genotype 5/5, 5/6, 6/6): Patients receive treatment as in group 2. In all
           groups, treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection at baseline and periodically during study for
      pharmacokinetics, dihydropyridine deaminase enzyme assay, and pathway expression analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 weeks for up to 2 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Biopsy confirmed diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancer

               -  Advanced, unresectable disease

          -  Measurable or evaluable (non-measurable) disease

               -  Measurable disease is defined as ≥ 1 lesion that can be accurately measured
                  (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 2.0 cm with conventional techniques or as
                  ≥ 1.0 cm with spiral CT scan

                    -  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are
