      Background:

      Background:

      - IMC-A12, a new cancer treatment that has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration, is an antibody that is designed to block the effects of a protein called
      Type I Insulin-Like Growth Factor (IGF-1R). IMC-A12 blocks the receptors in cells that
      respond to IGF-1R, which are thought to play an important role in helping cancer cells to
      grow and divide. Researchers are interested in determining whether IMC-A12 is an effective
      treatment for individuals who have mesothelioma that has not responded to standard
      chemotherapy.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of IMC-A12 treatment in individuals with
      mesothelioma who have previously had chemotherapy.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with mesothelioma that has
      not responded to chemotherapy.

      Design:

        -  Eligible participants will be screened with a full physical examination and medical
           history, blood and urine samples, and imaging studies.

        -  Participants will receive IMC-A12 once every 3 weeks (21-day cycle), and will be
           evaluated before the start of each new cycle with blood tests and imaging studies if
           needed.

        -  Treatment cycles will continue for as long as needed, unless severe side effects
           develop or the disease progresses.

      Background:

      Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for advanced unresectable malignant
      mesothelioma. New options for treatment are necessary in patients with advanced disease that
      have progressed on platinum-based therapy. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway is
      being studies in various malignancies including mesothelioma. IMC-A12 is an anti-IGF-1R
      monoclonal antibody that has shown activity in patients with various malignancies.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      - To determine the clinical response rate (partial response (PR)+complete response (CR)) to
      IMC-A12 monotherapy in patients with advanced mesothelioma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine response duration, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival
           (OS).

        -  To assess safety of IMC-A12 in patients with mesothelioma

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To evaluate tumor IGF-1R expression and correlation with response

        -  To correlate response to therapy with changes in  fludeoxyglucose 18F-positron emission
           tomography (FDG-PET) imaging.

        -  To monitor serum mesothelin and  cancer antigen 125 or carbohydrate antigen 125
           (CA-125) levels prior to and during therapy.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with histologically confirmed malignant pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma who
           have previously been treated on at least one platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen
           with progressive disease documented prior to study entry, or have refused cytotoxic
           chemotherapy.

        -  Measurable disease by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
           criteria for pleural mesothelioma or by RECIST criteria for peritoneal mesothelioma.

        -  Adequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function.

        -  No major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 28 days of
           IMC-A12 therapy

      Design:

        -  Patients will receive IMC-A12 at a dose of 20 mg/kg intravenously once every three
           weeks.

        -  Treatment with IMC-A12 alone will continue until disease progression.

        -  Toxicity will be assessed every cycle by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP)
           Version 4.0 of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

        -  Tumor response assessments will be performed every 2 cycles.

        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Subjects must have histologically confirmed pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma not
             amenable to potentially curative surgical resection. The diagnosis will be confirmed
             by the pathology department / Center for Cancer Research (CCR) / National Cancer
             Institute (NCI).

          2. Patients must have had at least one prior platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen.
             There is no limit to the number of prior chemotherapy regimens received.

          3. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;
             20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT)
             scan.

          4. Patients must not have had major surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biologic
             therapy (including any investigational agents), or hormonal therapy (other than
             replacement), within 4 weeks prior to entering the study and must have evidence of
             stable or progressive disease to be eligible.

          5. Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Since mesothelioma is extremely rare in
             children they are excluded from this study.

          6. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          7. Performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) less than or equal to 2.

          8. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function (as defined below).

               -  leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mm^3

               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm^3

               -  hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL

               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/ mm^3

               -  total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times institutional upper limit of
                  normal (ULN)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
                  (SGOT)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase(SGPT)
                  less than or equal to 3 times institutional ULN

                  (5 times if liver function test (LFT) elevations due to liver metastases)

               -  creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times institutional ULN

             OR

             - creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with
             creatinine

             levels above institutional normal

             Patients may be transfused to obtain a hemoglobin of greater than or equal to 9 g/Dl.

          9. The patient must have fasting serum glucose &lt;  160 mg/dL

         10. The effects of IMC-A12 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study therapy and
             for 3 months after the last dose of IMC-A12. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately. While hormonal methods of birth control are
             effective, we ask that female patients who are participating in the study cease
             hormonal forms of birth control, as these methods of birth control (birth control
             pills, injections, or implants) may affect the study drug. Patients must be off
             hormonal forms of birth control for at least 4 weeks prior to initiating the study.

         11. Ability to comply with intravenous administration schedule, and the ability to
             understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Inclusion of Women and Minorities

        Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.
        Every effort will be made to recruit women and minorities in this study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients with symptomatic brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical
             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive
             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other
             adverse events. However, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastases
             and whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for at least 3 months
             without steroids may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator.

          2. Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Patients with a history of
             diabetes mellitus are allowed to participate, provided their blood glucose is below
             160 mg/dL when fasting and if they are on a stable dietary or therapeutic regimen for
             this condition with their HbA1C of less than 7%.

          3. Uncontrolled medical illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or uncontrolled,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure (American Heart Association (AHA) Class II or
             worse), uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          4. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients with poorly controlled viral
             loads (viral load &gt;  50 copies HIV/ml), and/or acquired immune deficiency syndrome
             (AIDS)-defining illnesses will be excluded due to the possibility that IMC-A12 may
             worsen their condition and the likelihood that the underlying condition may obscure
             the attribution of adverse events with respect to IMC-A12. HIV positive patients with
             mesothelioma not meeting the above criteria can be considered for inclusion in the
             study.

          5. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          6. History of another invasive malignancy in the last five years. Adequately treated
             non-invasive, non-melanoma skin cancers as well as in situ carcinoma of the cervix
             will be allowed.

          7. Prior treatment with drugs of the IGF-1R inhibitor class.

          8. Patients with tumor amenable to potentially curative therapy as assessed by the
             investigator. In patients with peritoneal mesothelioma who have had no prior surgery,
             a surgical consultation will be obtained to see if the patient is a candidate for
             debulking surgery.

          9. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because IMC-A12 is a monoclonal antibody
             to IGF-1R with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Immunoglobulin
             G (IgG) antibody may also potentially be secreted in milk and therefore breastfeeding
             women should be excluded. Because of the potential of teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (barrier methods) before, during the study and for a period of 3 months
             after the last dose of the investigational agent.

         10. Patients must not be on hormonal forms of birth control or hormone replacement
             therapy, as this may affect the study drug. Patients must be off hormonal forms of
             birth control or hormone replacement therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to initiating
             the study.

         11. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to IMC-A12.
