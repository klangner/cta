  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a new drug called MK-2206. This study is a phase II
      study. In cancer studies, a phase II study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, a
      new treatment has against a certain type of cancer.

      MK-2206 is an oral medication known as a targeted therapy. By attaching to the target, we
      hope that MK-2206 may stop the cancer cells from further growth and dividing. This study
      will help find out if MK-2206 is a helpful drug when taken in patients with neuroendocrine
      tumor.
