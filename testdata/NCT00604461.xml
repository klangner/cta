    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study was to evaluate how effective the combination of
      Carboplatin, Bevacizumab (Avastin™) and, Pemetrexed (Alimta™) is in the treatment of
      patients with Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM). A combination of cisplatin and
      pemetrexed is considered standard for this disease and typically off protocol patients would
      receive cisplatin or carboplatin and pemetrexed as standard of care.

      The planned length of the study (first patient screened to last patient enrolled) was 24
      months.  The planned length of the entire study (enrollment period + the treatment period +
      a follow-up period of at least 12 months) was 36 months.

      This was a planned Phase I/II dose escalation study. Patients were enrolled in a cohort of
      3.

      Eligible patients with unresectable pleural mesothelioma received frontline treatment
      consisting of carboplatin AUC 5, bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, and pemetrexed 500 mg/m^2 every 21
      days (Tier-1). Dose escalation continued to achieve a target dosage using carboplatin AUC 6
      (Tier-2). After a maximum of 6 treatment cycles, non-progressing patients received
      maintenance therapy with bevacizumab and pemetrexed every 21 days to complete 1-year total
      treatment duration.

    <description>Chemotherapy was given for 2 cycles after maximal response. Patients were taken off study at the time of progression. If the patient had stable disease or better, as a response, then the patient was maintained on pemetrexed plus bevacizumab for a total of one year after initiation of maintenance or until progression which ever occured first. Computed tomography (CT) scans were be done every 12 weeks during the maintenance phase.</description>
