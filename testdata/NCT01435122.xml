  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see whether Axitinib will help prolong the time that
      the patient's carcinoid tumors remain stable, and to examine their treatment response
      through testing. Researchers also want to find out if Axitinib is safe and tolerable.

      This is a bi-institutional, prospective phase II, open-label study. The target population is
      comprised of adult patients with histologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic
      carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid tumors are defined as well to moderately differentiated
      neuroendocrine tumors of the digestive tract and lungs. Patients with metastatic carcinoid
      tumors of unknown primary as well as rare primaries (renal, ovarian, thymic, hepatic) will
      also be eligible. Patients will be drawn from two institutions Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC)
      and The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) determined as the time from administration of the initial dose of axitinib until objective tumor progression using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), or death. Progressive Disease (PD) Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.  Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

    <description>Tumor response rate using RECIST. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <description>Overall survival by Kaplan Meier, determined from the time of drug administration to death from any cause. The effect of an intervention is assessed by measuring the number of subjects survived or saved after that intervention over a period of time. The time starting from a defined point to the occurrence of a given event, for example death is called as survival time and the analysis of group data as survival analysis.</description>

    <description>Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all adverse events and serious adverse events, the regular monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry parameters and regular physical examinations. Adverse events will be evaluated continuously throughout the study. Safety and tolerability will be assessed according to the National Institute of Health/National Cancer Institute (NIH/NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAE v4) available at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.</description>

    <description>The investigational drug used in this study is axitinib, and is available as tablets.
You will take the tablet orally with food. Doses should be taken around 12 hours apart continuously, without scheduled breaks. If you vomit anytime after taking a dose do not take another tablet to &quot;make up the dose&quot; but instead continue taking your next dose as planned.
Any missed dose may be taken late (up to 3 hours before the next scheduled dose); otherwise it should be skipped. If doses are missed or vomited, please keep track of this and report at your next visit.</description>
