    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, efficacy and safety study of quarfloxin in
      patients with low or intermediate grade neuroendocrine cancer.  The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the rate of clinical benefit response to  quarfloxin treatment including the
      reduction in secretory symptoms of flushing and/or diarrhea or the reduction quantifiable
      hormones or other biochemical tumor markers.
