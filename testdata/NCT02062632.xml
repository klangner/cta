    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized clinical trial studies the effects, good and/or bad, of taking doxepin
      hydrochloride compared to placebo (inactive drug) in treating esophageal pain in patients
      with thoracic cancer receiving radiation therapy to the thorax with or without chemotherapy.
      Doxepin hydrochloride is a tricyclic antidepressant drug which was recently shown to be
      helpful for mouth pain in patients receiving radiation therapy. Part of doxepin
      hydrochloride's drug action takes place at the surface of the esophagus, which may be
      helpful in reducing the pain caused by radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide baseline data regarding the effectiveness of doxepin (doxepin hydrochloride)
      in reducing esophagitis-related pain in patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT) to the
      thorax, as measured by a patient-reported questionnaire at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30
      minutes, 1 hour and then at 2 and 4 hours on day 1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the adverse event profile of doxepin swish and swallow using a patient-reported
      questionnaire at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and then at 2 and 4 hours using
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
      (RTOG) acute toxicity criteria, and also for domains of unpleasant taste, burning/stinging
      discomfort, and drowsiness.

      II. To evaluate the effectiveness of doxepin in reducing esophagitis-related pain in
      patients undergoing RT to the thorax, as measured by a patient-reported questionnaire at 5
      minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hours and then at 2 and 4 hours on days 1 and 3
      (including the cross-over phase).

      III. To compare and provide baseline data regarding alternative analgesic use between the
      doxepin and placebo arms.

      IV. To provide baseline data regarding the patients' preference for continued therapy with
      doxepin or placebo after initial test dose or after the cross-over phase, as measured by
      items 9 and 10 in the patient-reported questionnaire at 4 hours after administration of the
      study medication and the actual participation rate.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess pain reduction and other adverse event profile in the optional continuation
      phase of doxepin oral rinse therapy.

      II. To explore the relationship of individual genetic variants of transforming growth factor
      beta 1 (TGFB1), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and angiotensin I converting enzyme
      (ACE) to baseline quality-of-life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of
      Cancer [EORTC] and Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Lung [FACT-L]) and treatment
      outcomes such as radiation-induced thoracic injuries (RITT) including esophagitis.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive doxepin hydrochloride oral solution (swish, gargle for 30 seconds,
      and slowly swallow) on day 1. Patients then crossover to Arm II on day 3.

      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo oral solution (swish, gargle for 30 seconds, and slowly
      swallow) on day 1. Patients then crossover to Arm I on day 3.

      In both arms, patients may continue to receive doxepin hydrochloride oral solution every 4
      hours as needed during radiation therapy.

    <description>Patients will assess their pain at baseline and at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes after treatment. The area under the curve (AUC) of these 6 time points will be adjusted by their baseline pain score and compared between groups. The primary endpoint will be based on the AUC values only in the first period before the crossover. This difference between groups will be tested using a one-sided t-test with a 10% type I error rate.</description>
