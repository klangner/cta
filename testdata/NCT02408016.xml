      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of genetically modified T cells
      in treating patients with stage III-IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or mesothelioma.
      Many types of cancer cells, including NSCLC and mesothelioma, but not most normal cells,
      have a protein called Wilms tumor (WT)1 on their surfaces. This study takes a type of immune
      cell from patients, called T cells, and modifies their genes in the laboratory so that they
      are programmed to find cells with WT1 and kill them. The T cells are then given back to the
      patient. Cyclophosphamide and aldesleukin may also stimulate the immune system to attack
      cancer cells. Giving cyclophosphamide and aldesleukin with laboratory-treated T cells may
      help the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety, and potential toxicities associated with treating patients with
      metastatic NSCLC and mesothelioma with polyclonal autologous central memory and naïve
      cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T cells that have been transduced to express a
      WT1-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) (Arm 1 and Arm 2).

      II. Determine the feasibility of treating patients with metastatic NSCLC and mesothelioma
      with polyclonal autologous central memory and naïve CD8+ T cells that have been transduced
      to express a WT1-specific TCR (Arm 1 and Arm 2).

      III. Determine and compare the in vivo persistence in blood and tumor of transferred
      polyclonal autologous central memory and naïve CD8+ T cells that have been transduced to
      express a WT1-specific TCR (Arm 1 and Arm 2).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the antitumor efficacy for patients with metastatic NSCLC and mesothelioma (Arm
      1), as measured by time to progression (TTP) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.

      II. Determine the in vivo functional capacity of adoptively transferred polyclonal
      autologous CD8+ T cells that have been transduced to express a WT1-specific TCR, and assess
      the acquisition of phenotypic characteristics associated with T cell exhaustion (Arm 1 and
      Arm 2).

      III. Determine the migration to tumor sites of adoptively transferred polyclonal autologous
      CD8+ T cells that have been transduced to express a WT1-specific TCR (Arm 2).

      IV. Evaluate the tumor response and T cell infiltration in tumors of patients with stage
      IIIA NSCLC treated in the neo-adjuvant setting.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced
      CD8-positive Tcm/Tn lymphocytes followed by a phase II study. Patients are assigned to 1 of
      3 treatment arms.

      ARM I, STAGE I: Patients receive autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced CD8-positive Tcm/Tn
      lymphocytes intravenously (IV) on days 0 and 14, cyclophosphamide IV on days 11 and 12, and
      aldesleukin (IL-2) subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) for 14 days. Patients who have
      received radiation to the chest/lung tissue may receive T lymphocytes 90 days after
      completion of radiation.

      ARM I, STAGE II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2, autologous
      WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced CD8-positive Tcm/Tn lymphocytes IV on day 0, and aldesleukin SC
      BID for 14 days.

      ARM II: Patients receive autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced CD8-positive Tcm/Tn
      lymphocytes IV between 24-96 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy and receive
      aldesleukin SC BID for 14 days. Patients then undergo surgery within 3-4 weeks after the
      T-cell infusion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months and
      then annually for 14 years.
