      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate 68Ga-DOTA TATE PET/CT for staging and
      monitoring response to chemotherapy in patients with carcinoid, neuroendocrine tumors,
      medullary thyroid cancer and other cancers expressing somatostatin receptors.

          -  Provides written informed consent

          -  Known diagnosis of NET or suspected SSTR positive tumors by 111In-Octreotide scan,

          -  Karnofsky score greater than 50 or ECOG Performance Status 0-2

          -  Women of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test at screening/baseline

          -  Able to remain still for duration of each imaging procedure (about one hour)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than 18 years-old at the time of radiotracer administration

          -  Pregnant or nursing

          -  Serum creatinine &gt;3.0 mg/dL

          -  Hepatic enzyme levels more than 5 times upper limit of normal.

          -  Use of any other investigational product or device within 30 days prior to dosing, or
             known requirement for any other investigational agent prior to completion of all
             scheduled study assessments.

          -  Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time

          -  Inability to complete the needed investigational and standard-of-care imaging
             examinations due to other reasons (severe claustrophobia, radiation phobia, etc.)

          -  Any additional medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere
