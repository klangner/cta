      The primary objective of this study is to determine if Gallium-68 labeled DOTA-TOC will
      result in the delineation of more lesions in patients with somatostatin receptor positive
      malignancies than with conventional imaging.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected somatostatin receptor positive tumor such as carcinoid;
             neuroendocrine tumor; neuroblastoma; pheochromocytoma.  Supporting evidence may
             include MRI, CT, biochemical markers, and or pathology report.

          -  Age &gt; 18.

          -  Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 50 (or ECOG/WHO equivalent).

          -  Not pregnant. A negative serum pregnancy test is required for all female subjects
             with child-bearing potential.

          -  Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to
             sign it

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hepatic enzymes 5 times greater than the upper limits of normal, serum creatinine &gt;
             3.0 mg/dL (270 uM/L)

          -  Patients exceeding the weight limitations of the scanner or are not able to enter the
             bore of the PET/CT scanner due to BMI

          -  Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (e.g. cough, severe arthritis,
             etc.)

          -  Inability to complete the needed investigational and standard-of-care imaging
             examinations due to other reasons (severe claustrophobia, radiation phobia, etc.)

          -  Any additional medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere
             with study compliance

          -  Recognized concurrent active infection

          -  Previous systemic or radiation treatment for another cancer of any type within the
             last 2 months

          -  Use of any other investigational product or device within 30 days prior to dosing, or
             known requirement for any other investigational agent prior to completion of all
             scheduled study assessments.
