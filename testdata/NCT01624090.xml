      Background:

      - Mithramycin is a drug that was first tested as a cancer therapy in the 1960s. It acted
      against some forms of cancer, but was never accepted as a treatment. Research suggests that
      it may be useful against some cancers of the chest, such as lung and esophageal cancer or
      mesothelioma. Researchers want to see if mithramycin can be used to treat these types of
      cancer.

      Objectives:

      - To see if mithramycin is safe and effective against different chest cancers.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have lung, esophagus, pleura, or mediastinum
      cancers.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies and tumor tissue samples will be used to
           monitor the cancer before treatment.

        -  Participants will receive mithramycin every day for 7 days, followed by 14 days without
           treatment. Each 28-day round of treatment is called a cycle.

        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.

        -  Participants will continue to take the drug for as long as the side effects are not
           severe and the tumor responds to treatment.

      Background:

      Increasing evidence indicates that activation of stem cell gene expression is a common
      mechanism by which environmental carcinogens mediate initiation and progression of thoracic
      malignancies. Similar mechanisms appear to contribute to extra-thoracic malignancies that
      metastasize to the chest. Utilization of pharmacologic agents, which target gene regulatory
      networks mediating    stemness    may be novel strategies for treatment of these neoplasms.
      Recent studies performed in the Thoracic Oncology Laboratory, SB/NCI, demonstrate that under
      exposure conditions potentially achievable in clinical settings, mithramycin diminishes stem
      cell gene expression and markedly inhibits growth of lung and esophageal cancer and MPM
      cells in vitro and in vivo. These finding add to other recent preclinical studies
      demonstrating impressive anti-tumor activity of mithramycin in epithelial malignancies and
      sarcomas that frequently metastasize to the thorax.

      Primary Objective:

      To assess clinical response rates of mithramycin administered as 6hour intravenous
      infusionsin patients with malignancies involving lungs, esophagus, pleura, or mediastinum.

      Eligibility:

      Patients with histologically or cytologically proven primary malignancies involving lungs,
      esophagus, pleura or mediastinum, or extra-thoracic malignancies metastatic to the chest.

      Patients must have had or refused first-line standard therapy for their malignancies.

      Patients must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0     2, without
      evidence of unstable or decompensated myocardial disease. Patients must have adequate
      pulmonary reserve evidenced by FEV1 and DLCO equal to or greater than 30% predicted; pCO(2)
      less than 55 mm Hg and pO(2) greater than 60 mm Hg on room air ABG.

      Patients must have a platelet count greater than 100,000, an ANC equal to or greater than
      1500 without transfusion or cytokine support, a normal PT, and adequate hepatic function as
      evidenced by a total bilirubin of &lt; 1.5 times upper limits of normal.  Serum creatinine less
      than 3 or equal to 1.6 mg/ml, or creatinine clearance greater than 70 ml/min/1.73m2 at the
      time vaccination commences.

      Design:

      Simon Optimal Two Stage Design for Phase II Clinical Trials targeting an objective response
      rate (RECIST) of 30%.

      Patients will be stratified based on location of primary disease (thoracic vs.
      extra-thoracic).

      Patients will receive 6hour infusions of mithramycin at 30 mcg/kg every day for 7 days,
      every 28 days (1 cycle). Two cycles will constitute one course of therapy.

      Following each course of therapy, patients will undergo restaging studies. Patients
      exhibiting objective response to therapy or stable disease by RECIST criteria will be
      offered an additional course of therapy.

      Patients exhibiting disease progression will be removed from study.

      Biopsies of index lesions will be obtained at baseline and on day 8 of the second cycle of

      therapy for analysis of molecular end-points.

      Pharmacokinetics will be assessed during cycle 1 and cycle 2 of the first course of therapy.
