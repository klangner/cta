    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the safety of combination gene therapy and chemotherapy
      in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Pleural catheter will be placed first, then
      pts will receive 2 doses of intrapleural vector followed by front line or second line
      chemotherapy 4-6 cycles every 21 days.

    <textblock>
      Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a cancer for which there is no cure. The most
      effective combination chemotherapy, Pemetrexed (Alimta)/Cisplatin, has yielded overall
      response rates of up to 40%, but with improvements in overall median survival of only 3.5
      months. Prior Phase I trials of intrapleural infusion (IP) of Ad.hIFN-beta (BG00001) were
      safe. The most recent trial of IP Ad.IFNalpha (SCH 721015) at a dose of 3e11 viral particles
      (vp) given three days apart was safe and well tolerated, and showed high levels of IFN in
      pleural fluid and serum. Our preclinical data modeling this proposed study suggest that two
      IP doses of Ad.IFN-alpha in combination with chemotherapy are well tolerated and markedly
      enhances efficacy. The purpose of the new study is to determine the safety of administrating
      intrapleural SCH 721015 (Ad.hIFN-alpha 2b) in combination with chemotherapy for the
      management of malignant pleural mesothelioma. This study will enroll subjects with pleural
      mesothelioma. Subjects will receive two fixed dosed of SCH 721015 followed by 4-6 cycles of
      chemotherapy. Subjects will require placement of a pleural catheter for administration of
      SCH 721015.

      Some patients require a pleural catheter for control of pleural fluid while some will have
      it placed for research purpose only. Protocol participation is up to 15 years.

    <description>No dose escalation is planned; however, dose de-escalation is possible should two or more DLTs be encountered in the first six patients treated. With 0 DLTs in 6 patients at a given dose, the upper exact 90% confidence limit on the DLT rate is 32%. With 1 DLT in 6 patients, the Bayesian upper 90% probability limit on the DLT rate is 58%. With 10 subjects per treatment group, we can identify with 90% power any unanticipated toxicity that has prevalence at least 20.6%; with n=15 per group, this figure decreases to 14.2%.</description>
