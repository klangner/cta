  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immune response to MUC1 - poly-ICLC vaccine, an
      investigational or study vaccine. The MUC1 - poly-ICLC vaccine is being tested in persons
      with a history of advanced adenomatous polyps, the precursor to colorectal cancer.  The MUC1
      - poly-ICLC vaccine is being developed to prevent polyps from advancing into colon cancer
      and to prevent polyps from recurring.

      MUC1 is mucus that is normally present on the lining of the human colon. However, MUC1 is
      expressed in a larger amount and in a modified form on adenomatous polyps and colorectal
      cancer. These changes in MUC1 are thought to be part of the process of progression from
      adenomas toward cancer. The goal of a vaccine is to help the immune system in the body
      identify the changes in MUC1 that accompany the progression to cancer and eliminate the
      abnormal cells that make abnormal MUC1.

      This is a phase II trial designed to assess antibody and T cell responses to MUC1 vaccine
      among subjects at increased risk for colorectal cancer by virtue of a history of advanced
      adenoma. The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of a combination of the
      100mer MUC1 peptide and adjuvant Poly-ICLC in boosting the immune response to MUC1. Among
      the secondary objectives is to determine if anti-MUC1 immunity, preexisting or vaccine
      induced, has an effect on the recurrence of polyps. Subjects with a history of advanced
      adenoma will be recruited for MUC1 vaccination. Vaccine will be administered at weeks 0, 2,
      and 10. Some subjects may have pre-existing immunity to MUC1, and this will be accounted for
      in the analytic phase. However, all subjects will be administered the vaccine, regardless of
      baseline antibody status. To insure accurate standardization in measurement and assessment
      of antibody levels, assays for baseline antibody status will be done at the same time as
      those for response to vaccine.

    <description>The vaccine will be administered on an outpatient basis in the Digestive Disorders Clinic. The total volume of each dose of vaccine MUC1+ POLY-ICLC will be approximately 250 microliters subcutaneously (SQ) in the upper thigh. The site of injection will remain the same thigh, to enhance the potential immune response.</description>

          -  History of any of the following conditions (operative notes, endoscopy reports,
             and/or pathology reports must be reviewed locally to confirm that the candidate meets
             at least one of the following entry criteria).

               1. Colorectal adenoma(s) ≥ 1 cm in maximal diameter

               2. Colorectal adenoma(s) with villous or tubulovillous histology

               3. Colorectal adenoma(s) with high-grade dysplasia

             ≥100,000/µL.

          -  AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, BUN, creatinine ≤ 1.5x
             upper limit of institutional normal.

          -  Receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Presence of an active acute or chronic infection

          -  Patients with a history of auto-immune disease such as, but not restricted to,
             inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis,
             ankylosing spondylitis, scleroderma, or multiple sclerosis.

          -  Pregnant women, because the teratogenic or abortifacient effects of the study agents
             remain incompletely defined. Breastfeeding women, because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with the study agents.
