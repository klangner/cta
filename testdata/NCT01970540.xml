      Phase I Multicenter, Open-label, Clinical and Pharmacokinetic Study of PM01183 in
      Combination with Fixed Doxorubicin in Non- Heavily Pretreated Patients with Selected
      Advanced Solid Tumors to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose
      (RD) of PM01183 in combination with doxorubicin, to characterize the safety profile and
      feasibility of this combination, to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of this
      combination, to obtain preliminary information on the clinical antitumor activity and to
      evaluate the pharmacogenomics (PGx) in tumor samples of patients exposed to PM01183 and
      doxorubicin at the RD in order to assess potential markers of response and/or resistance.

      The study has currently met its primary end point and is now recruiting patients to be
      treated at the RD expansion cohort of selected tumor types, specifically: endometrial
      adenocarcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).
