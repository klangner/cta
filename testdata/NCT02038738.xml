  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine cancer is an unusual disease and often goes undetected by routine imaging.
      The 68Ga-DOTATATE PET Scan is a novel scanning method that may have improved sensitivity and
      resolution specifically for neuroendocrine tumors. Patients with neuroendocrine tumors will
      be imaged with this agent and it will be compared to conventional imaging methods to
      determine the safety and efficacy of this radiopharmaceutical.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Known diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumor or suspected SSTR positive tumors by
             111In-Octreotide scan, 18FDG-PET, or MRI of the abdomen where clinically indicated

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Able to provide informed consent

          -  Karnofsky performance score greater than 50

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening/baseline

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Hepatic enzyme levels more than 3 times upper limit of normal

          -  Known severe allergy or hypersensitivity to IV radiographic contrast

          -  Use of any other investigational product or device within 30 days prior to dosing, or
             known requirement for any other investigational agent prior to completion of all
             scheduled study assessments

          -  Patients with a body weight of 400 pounds or more or not able to enter the bore of
             the PET/CT scanner due to BMI, because of the compromise in image quality with CT,
             PET/CT, and MRI that will result

          -  Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (e.g. cough, severe arthritis,
             etc.)

          -  Inability to complete the needed investigational standard-of-care imaging
             examinations due to other reasons (severe claustrophobia, radiation phobia, etc.)

          -  Recognized concurrent active infection

          -  Previous systemic or radiation treatment for another cancer of any type within the
             last 2 years

          -  Any additional medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere
             with study compliance
