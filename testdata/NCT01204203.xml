  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the response rate of single agent
      zoledronic acid using a composite of criteria including the EORTC modified RECIST criteria
      and the EORTC tumor response criteria for 18F-FDG PET scans.

      This pilot study will examine the effect of bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid) in patients
      with malignant mesothelioma.  Evaluation will be limited to patients with standard (CT
      scans) and functional instruments (FDG PET Scans) of tumor assessment after the
      administration of standard doses of zoledronic acid (4 mg IV every 3 weeks).  We will also
      explore the biologic effect of zoledronic acid in patients using new serum markers as well
      as several blood level markers.

    <description>The best objective response from either the modified RECIST (CT scan) or the Metabloic Response (PET scan) efficacy method of evaluation will be used to determine the first evaluation after 2 cycles of treatment. In subsequent evaluations for response, modified RECIST with CT scans will be the only instrument to evaluate the response to therapy.</description>
