  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will be patients diagnosed with or suspected to have a thyroid
      function disorder.  These conditions may include:  hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroid
      hormone resistance, Graves' Dermopathy, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secreting
      pituitary adenomas.

      The main purpose of this study is to further understand the natural history, clinical
      presentation, and genetics of thyroid function disorders.  Many of the tests performed are
      in the context of standard medical care that is offered to all patients with thyroid
      function disorders.  In addition, blood and tissue samples may be taken for research and
      genetic studies....

      Patients with thyroid function abnormalities (hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism) are studied
      and

      treated in this protocol. A limited number of patients with a personal history of signs,
      symptoms or laboratory studies consistent with thyroid dysfunction or a strong family
      history of thyroid abnormalities are also enrolled. Patients undergo routine history and
      physical examination, standard endocrine blood and urine tests, a standard TRH test, thyroid
      nuclear medicine scan, thyroidal radioiodine (RAI) or technetium (99mTc) uptake
      measurements, as well as X-ray, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      studies or other standard diagnostic procedures, as clinically indicated. Patients will be
      screened for entry into other research studies.
