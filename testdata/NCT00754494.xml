    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying how well erlotinib hydrochloride works in
      treating patients with stage I-III colorectal cancer or adenoma. Erlotinib hydrochloride may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by
      blocking blood flow to the tumor. Erlotinib hydrochloride may also stop tumors from growing
      or coming back

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the hypothesis that erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) doses as low as 25 mg
      will decrease aberrant crypt foci (ACF) phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated
      kinases (pERK) levels from baseline (pre) to post erlotinib treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the hypothesis that additional epidermal growth factor (EGF) inducible biomarkers
      will decrease from baseline (pre) to post treatment with erlotinib 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) therapy.

      II. To determine the mean decrease from baseline of the ACF: normal mucosa pERK ratio pre
      and post 8-30 days of erlotinib.

      III. To determine erlotinib concentration in plasma and colorectal tissue at 25 mg, 50 mg
      and 100 mg doses after 8-30 days of therapy.

      IV. To determine the incidence of rash, diarrhea and other side effects of low dose
      erlotinib.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive 100 mg of erlotinib hydrochloride PO and two 25 mg of placebo PO QD.

      ARM II: Patients receive 50 mg of erlotinib hydrochloride PO and one 100 mg of placebo PO
      QD.

      ARM III: Patients receive 25 mg of erlotinib hydrochloride PO and one 100 mg of placebo and
      one 25 mg of placebo PO QD.

      In all arms, treatment continues for 8-30 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 to 9 weeks.

    <description>pEGFR expression levels were quantified by immunoblotting and calculated as the ratio of the pEGFR signals to reference signals. A log-transformation of pEGFR was utilized in primary analyses.
