          -  The patient must have a tumor measurable according to Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines, measurable by elevated tumor markers (eg, 24-hour
             urine 5-HIAA, chromogranin A, ACTH, gastrin, or other tumor specific biochemical
             markers), or both

          -  The patient is age ≥ 18 years

             study

          -  The patient has received 0 - 2 systemic anticancer regimens in addition to depot
             octreotide, which may have included chemotherapy, interferon, antiangiogenic therapy,
             other targeted treatments, or a combination of such treatments

          -  The patient is no longer a candidate for surgery, embolization, or radiofrequency
             ablation therapy

             progression while on a regimen that includes octreotide

          -  The patient has completed prior chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy with curative intent
             at least 3 weeks prior to the administration of the first dose of study therapy.
             Patients that have received palliative radiation therapy to bony metastases prior to
             the first dose of study medication are eligible

          -  The patient has a life expectancy of &gt; 3 months

          -  The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of
             0-2

             regimen for this condition

          -  The patient has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, symptomatic congestive
             heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia,
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements
