  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study have been diagnosed with a tumor such as a carcinoid,
      neuroendocrine tumor, neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, or brain tumor that has cells which
      carry somatostatin receptors.

      The purpose of this research study is to see if the tumor can be identified using a special
      procedure called a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and how the results of this
      imaging procedure will change the management of the tumor.

      This is a prospective, Phase II, single center, open-label study in a total of 200
      participants with histologically proven neuroendocrine tumor or other somatostatin receptor
      positive tumors. Eligible participants will undergo baseline assessments at enrollment. They
      will receive 68Ga-DOTATOC and undergo a PET/CT imaging study. Participants may receive a
      second 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT for restaging after therapy 12-36 months following the first
      scan.

    <description>Referring physicians will be asked to fill out pre-PET and post-PET scan forms to provide information on the management and treatment strategy of the patient before the PET-CT scan and after the information from the PET-CT study is available. This is the same methodology used in the National Oncologic PET Registry study; change in management strategy criteria are modified for the specific treatment strategies used in NET (Table 2).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent

          2. Age ≥ 6 months

          3. Histologically diagnosed neuroendocrine tumor or other tumor with probable
             somatostatin receptors subtype 2

          4. Karnofsky performance status or Lansky Play Scale status of ≥ 50 (or ECOG/WHO
             equivalent)

          5. Subject is male; or is a female who is either pre-menarchal, surgically sterile (has
             had a documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or documented hysterectomy),
             postmenopausal (&gt; 1 years without menses), non-lactating, or of childbearing
             potential for whom a serum pregnancy test (with the results known prior to
             investigational product administration) is negative. A negative serum pregnancy test
             will be required for all female subjects with child bearing potential. If a false
             pregnancy test is suspected, e.g., perimenopausal condition, an obstetrician will be
             consulted to determine if she is/is capable of becoming pregnant.

          6. No antiangiogenic therapy, chemotherapy, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT)
             within 4 weeks of Ha-68 DOTATOC PET/CT scan

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject weighs more than 400 pounds. (Subjects who weigh more than 400 pounds will
             not be able to fit inside the imaging machines.)

          2. Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (due to cough, severe arthritis,
             etc.)

          3. Inability to complete the needed investigational and standard-of-care imaging
             examinations due to other reasons (severe claustrophobia, radiation phobia, etc.)

          4. Any additional medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, may significantly interfere
             with study compliance.
