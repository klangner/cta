      This clinical trial studies gallium Ga 68-edotreotide positron emission tomography
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) compared with indium In 111 pentetreotide plus
      contrast-enhanced CT (or MRI) in diagnosing patients with neuroendocrine tumors and other
      somatostatin receptor positive tumors. Diagnostic procedures, such as gallium Ga
      68-edotreotide PET/CT, may help find and diagnose somatostatin receptor positive
      neuroendocrine tumors. It is not yet known whether Ga 68-edotreotide PET/CT is as effective
      as indium In 111 pentetreotide plus contrast-enhanced CT (or MRI) in diagnosis and staging
      of patients with neuroendocrine tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare efficacy of [68Ga]-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) (gallium Ga
      68-edotreotide) PET/CT with Octreoscan (indium In 111 pentetreotide) + high-resolution,
      contrast-enhanced CT for diagnosis and staging in patients with somatostatin receptor
      expressing tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gallium Ga 68-edotreotide intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT scan.
      Within 120 days, patients undergo standard indium In 111 pentetreotide contrast-enhanced CT
      or MRI scan. Patients may also undergo a second gallium Ga 68-edotreotide PET/CT scan within
      3-6 months if the lesions of the first scan cannot be confirmed.

             somatostatin receptor positive tumor

          -  Off Sandostatin (octreotide acetate)-long acting release (LAR) &gt; 4 weeks and off
             immediate release (subcutaneous) for 12 hrs prior to 68Ga-DOTATOC PET-CT

          -  Karnofsky performance status or Lansky Play Scale status of &gt;= 50 (or Eastern

             potential for whom a serum pregnancy test (with the results known prior to
             investigational product administration) is negative; a negative serum pregnancy test
             will be required for all female subjects with child bearing potential; if a false
             pregnancy test is suspected, e.g., perimenopausal condition, an obstetrician will be
             consulted to determine if she is/is capable of becoming pregnant

          -  No therapy other than Sandostatin since last Octreoscan + diagnostic CT

          -  Fresh frozen (recommended) or paraffin fixed (required) specimen of primary or
             metastases available for ribonucleic acid (RNA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding

          -  Surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biologic therapy since last
             Octreoscan + CT; continuation of the same dose of Sandostatin-LAR or subcutaneous
             Sandostatin is allowed

          -  Medical condition uncontrolled by treatment making completion of study unlikely

          -  Weight more than 400 pounds (subjects who weigh more than 400 pounds will not be able
             to fit inside the imaging machines)

          -  Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (e.g. cough, severe arthritis,
             etc.)

          -  Inability to complete the needed investigational and standard-of-care imaging
             examinations due to other reasons (severe claustrophobia, radiation phobia, etc.)

          -  Any additional medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, may significantly interfere
             with study compliance
