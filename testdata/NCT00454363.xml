  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well pazopanib works in treating patients with advanced
      neuroendocrine cancer. Pazopanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the objective response rate (complete and partial response) in patients with
      low- or intermediate-grade advanced neuroendocrine carcinoma treated with pazopanib
      hydrochloride.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

      II. Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease type
      (carcinoid tumors vs islet cell carcinoma).

      Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 18
      months.

             at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;/= 20 mm with
             conventional techniques or as &gt;/= 10 mm with spiral CT scan.

          -  Received 0, or 1 prior cytotoxic therapy. Chemotherapy used as a radiosensitizer will
             be considered one prior chemotherapy regimen. Must not have received prior

          -  Must have PT/INR/PTT within 1.2 X the upper limit of normal.

          -  Must have resting blood pressure (BP) no greater than 140 mmHg (systolic) or 90 mmHg
             (diastolic) for eligibility. Initiation or adjustment of BP medication is permitted
             prior to study entry.

          -  The effects of GW786034 (pazopanib) on the developing human fetus are unknown.
             However, teratogenic effects and reduced fetal body weight have been seen in pregnant
             rats and/or rabbits given GW786034 (pazopanib). For this reason and because
             antiangiogenic agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are
             known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use
             adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative blood pregnancy test prior to
             study entry. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Acceptable contraceptive methods, when used consistently and in accordance with both
             the product label and the instructions of the physician, are as follows: An
             intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year;
             Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female patient's entry and is the
             sole sexual partner for that female;

          -  Acceptable contraceptive methods, when used consistently and in accordance with both
             the product label and the instructions of the physician, are as follows; Complete
             abstinence from sexual intercourse for 14 days before exposure to investigation
             product, through the clinical trial, and for at least 21 days after the last dose of
             investigational product; Double-barrier contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly,
             foam suppository, or film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male condom and diaphragm
             with spermicide). Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drug-drug
             interaction.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

          -  Ability to swallow and retain oral medication

          -  Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this
             trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment. At
             least 4 weeks must have elapsed since any major surgery prior to study enrollment.

          -  May not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  With QTc &gt; 480msecs

          -  With greater than +1 (&gt;/= 100 mg/dl) proteinuria on two consecutive routine
             urinalyses taken at least 1 week apart are ineligible.

          -  Certain medications that act through the CYP450 system are specifically prohibited in
             patients receiving GW786034 (pazopanib) because in vitro data indicate that the agent
             has the potential to interact with the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Certain other
             agents should be used with caution. A list of medications that are specifically
             prohibited or that should be used with caution during this trial of GW786034
             (pazopanib) can be found in Section 8. Selected lists of agents that could affect
             GW786034 (pazopanib) through the cytochrome P450 system can be found in Appendix II.

          -  With any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to
             take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures
             affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that impairs their ability to
             swallow and retain GSK786034 (pazopanib) tablets are excluded.

          -  With any of the following conditions are excluded: Serious or non-healing wound,
             ulcer, or bone fracture; History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation,
             or intra-abdominal abscess within 28 days of treatment; History of known active
             diverticulitis within the past 3 months; Any history of cerebrovascular accident
             (CVA) within the last 6 months; Current use of therapeutic warfarin.(Low molecular
             weight heparin and prophylactic low-dose warfarin are permitted); PT/PTT must meet
             the inclusion criteria.

          -  With any of the following conditions are excluded: History of myocardial infarction,
             cardiac arrhythmia, admission for unstable angina, cardiac angioplasty or stenting
             within the last 12 weeks; History of venous thrombosis in last 12 weeks; Class III or
             IV heart failure as defined by the NYHA functional classification system; A patient
             who has a history of Class II heart failure and is asymptomatic on treatment may be
             considered eligible.

          -  With known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of
             their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse
             events.

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or other adequately treated in situ cancer,
             or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for five years.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because GW786034 (pazopanib) is an
             antiangiogenic agent which has produced teratogenic effects and reduced fetal body
             weight in pregnant rats and/or rabbits, and therefore has the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects in humans. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with GW786034 (pazopanib), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother
             is treated with GW786034 (pazopanib). These potential risks may also apply to other
             agents used in this study.

          -  HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the
             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with GW786034 (pazopanib).

          -  Uncontrolled diarrhea (8 or more bowel movements per day)
