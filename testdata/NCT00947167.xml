      To determine objective response rates (RR) by RECIST guideline version 1.1 for all patients
      treated with this strategy consisting of initial therapy with pertuzumab as a single agent
      and then addition of erlotinib for those who have stable disease or progressive disease at
      three months (Simon design).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must be treated at Stanford University Medical Center for the entire length of
        study participation.

          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed well-differentiated
             neuroendocrine tumor.  Patients must be deemed unresectable due to involvement of
             critical vasculature or adjacent organ invasion or have metastatic disease.

          2. Patients with prior surgical resection who develop radiological or clinical evidence
             of metastatic cancer do not require separate histological or cytological confirmation
             of metastatic disease unless an interval of &gt; 5 years has elapsed between the primary
             surgery and the development of metastatic disease.  Clinicians should consider biopsy
             of lesions to establish diagnosis of metastatic disease if there is substantial
             clinical ambiguity regarding the nature or source of apparent metastases.

          3. Prior chemotherapy will be permitted.

          4. Prior or concurrent somatostatin analogue use will be permitted.

          5. Patients must have a primary or metastatic lesion measurable in at least one
             dimension by Modified RECIST criteria (v1.1) within 4 weeks prior to entry of study.

          6. Patients must have ECOG performance status of 0-2.

          7. Patients must be &gt;= 18 years of age.

          8. Laboratory values &lt;= 2 weeks prior to randomization:

               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) &gt;= 1.5 x 109/L (&gt;= 1500/mm3)

               -  Platelets (PLT) &gt;= 50 x 109/L (&gt;= 100,000/mm3) (or &gt;= 25 x 109/L (&gt;=
                  100,000/mm3) if thrombocytopenia is secondary to a non-myelosuppressive cause
                  such as splenic sequestration).

               -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt;= 9 g/dL

               -  Serum creatinine &lt;= 1.5 x ULN

               -  Serum bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x ULN  (&lt;= 3.0 x ULN  if liver metastases present)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) &lt;=
                  3.0 x ULN (&lt;= 5.0 x ULN if liver metastases present).  Note:  ERCP or
                  percutaneous stenting may be used to normalize the liver function tests.

               -  Albumin &gt;= 1.5

          9. LVEF by TTE or MUGA &gt;= 50%

         10. Life expectancy &gt;= 12 weeks

         11. Ability to give written informed consent according to local guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Disease-Specific Exclusions

               1. Prior full field radiotherapy &lt;= 4 weeks or limited field radiotherapy &lt;= 2
                  weeks prior to enrollment.  Patients must have recovered from all
                  therapy-related toxicities.  The site of previous radiotherapy should have
                  evidence of progressive disease if this is the only site of disease.

               2. Prior biologic or immunotherapy &lt;= 2 weeks prior to registration. Patients must
                  have recovered from all therapy-related toxicities

               3. If history of other primary cancer, subject will be eligible only if she or he
                  has:

               2. History of any medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that
                  in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risks associated with study
                  participation or study drug administration or may interfere with the conduct of
                  the study or interpretation of study results

               3. Male subject who is not willing to use adequate contraception upon enrollment
