  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study of ADI-PEG 20 (pegylated arginine deiminase), an arginine degrading enzyme in
      patients with histologically proven advanced MPM, advanced peritoneal mesothelioma (for dose
      escalation cohort only) or non-squamous NSCLC (stage IIIB/IV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weekly ADI-PEG 20 will be cohort dose escalated (18, 27 and 36 mg/m2), with pemetrexed 500
      mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 both given every 3 weeks. Subjects may receive a maximum of 6 -
      3 week cycles of ADIPemCis for a total of 18 weeks of treatment. Those subjects completing
      18 weeks may continue on ADI-PEG 20 monotherapy if they have SD or better.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven advanced MPM, advanced peritoneal mesothelioma (for dose
             escalation cohort only) or non-squamous NSCLC (stage IIIB/IV) who have not been
             treated with prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy, except that NSCLC subjects with
             EGFR mutant or ALK positive must have had an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) or
             ALK inhibitor and progressed or been shown to be intolerant of therapy prior to
             enrolling in this trial, if such ALK inhibitor and EGFR targeted therapy are approved
             and available in the country in which patients are being enrolled.

          -  ASS1 deficiency (defined as â‰¤50% ASS expression) demonstrated on tissue specimen
             (cytospin samples are acceptable) by immunohistochemistry (IHC).  biopsy

          -  ECOG 0-1

          -  Predicted life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons), targeted therapy, or immunotherapy the
             previous four weeks before study treatment

          -  Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments.  Exceptions to this are alopecia
             or certain Grade 1 toxicities, which in the opinion of the Investigator are stable
             and with the trial sponsor approval should not exclude the patient

          -  Symptomatic brain (patients must be stable for &gt; 1 month post radiotherapy or
             surgery) or spinal cord metastases

          -  Major thoracic or abdominal surgery from which the patient has not yet recovered

          -  Therapeutic anticoagulation (prophylactic dose low molecular weight heparin is
             acceptable).
