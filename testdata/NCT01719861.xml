    <textblock>
      Intrapatient dose escalation of desipramine. Start at 75 mg daily. Increase by 75 mg weekly
      to maximum of 450 mg daily.  Taper desipramine upon disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity or patient withdrawal from study.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of small cell lung cancer and high-grade
      neuroendocrine tumors in patients during treatment with desipramine.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

        -  To perform exploratory blood biomarker analysis of PCSK1 and ROBO1 in patients enrolled
           on this trial.

        -  To measure safety of desipramine using type, frequency and severity of adverse event
           reactions reported according to CTCAE v4.0

        -  To measure tolerability using the incidence of adverse events (AEs) leading to
           desipramine delay or discontinuation

        -  To establish the MTD of desipramine in each patient by adhering to an intrapatient dose
           escalation schema

        -  To measure serum desipramine levels during treatment
