      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in this study:

          1. Are at least 18 years of age at the time of informed consent.

          2. Have confirmed diagnosis of MPM with the following characteristics:

               1. Unresectable disease (defined as the subject not being a candidate for curative
                  surgery).

               2. Epithelial type.

               3. Have an archived tissue sample to be submitted either as a formalin fixed
                  paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor block, or 5 to 15 unstained slides.

          3. Have measurable disease at Screening by computed tomography (CT) (or magnetic
             resonance imaging [MRI]) as defined by at least 1 lesion of greater than or equal to
             1.5 cm in the longest diameter for a non-lymph node or greater than or equal to 1.5
             cm in the short-axis diameter for a lymph node that is serially measurable according
             to the modified RECIST criteria.

          4. Have other significant medical conditions well-controlled and stable in the opinion
             of the investigator for at least 30 days prior to Day 1.

          5. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0 or 1 at
             Screening.

          6. Have a life expectancy of at least 3 months, as estimated by the investigator.

          7. Have adequate organ reserve as determined by laboratory test results obtained within
             2 weeks prior to Study Day 1 as indicated below:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9/L.

               2. Platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x 10^9/L.

               3. Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL.

               4. Serum bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)
                  (Subjects with serum bilirubin abnormalities greater than this specified limit
                  are eligible only if they have known Gilberts disease).

               5. Aspartate aminotransferase less than or equal to 3 x ULN.

               6. Alanine aminotransferase less than or equal to 3 x ULN.

               7. Alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 3 x ULN.

          8. Have a calculated serum creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 45 mL/min using
             the Cockcroft-Gault equation.

          9. Pregnant and/or lactating females are excluded; a negative beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (beta-hCG) is required during Screening, and a separate assessment is
             required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours
             before the first dose of Test Article.

         10. Subjects of childbearing potential must be surgically sterile or consent to use a
             medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the study period. All females
             will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal
             (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age group, and
             without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically (ie,
             bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy). If a
             patient of childbearing potential is neither surgically sterile nor postmenopausal,
             contraceptive measures must start either prior to or at Screening and continue
             throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after the last dose of Test
             Article is administered.

         11. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they
             and their female partners must meet the criteria above (ie, not of childbearing
             potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period
             and for 5 weeks after Test Article discontinuation). No sperm donation is allowed
             during the study period and for 90 days after Test Article discontinuation.

         12. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent.

         13. Be willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:

          1. Have any history of the following:

               1. Prior systemic therapy or radiotherapy for MPM; local radiotherapy of
                  noncurative intent (ie, for prevention of instrument-tract recurrence [National
                  Comprehensive Cancer Network, 2013] and/or symptom control) is permitted.

               2. Evidence of other active, invasive malignancy requiring treatment within the
                  past 5 years.

          2. Currently have mesothelioma of the sarcomatous type, mixed histologic disease, or
             have malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.

          3. Have confirmed presence of central nervous system metastases.

          4. Active viral hepatitis or active human immunodeficiency virus infection.

          5. Have evidence of any other serious systemic disease, including active bacterial or
             fungal infection, or any medical condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator(s) could affect the subject's safety or interfere with the study
             assessments.

          6. Clinically significant heart disease (eg, congestive heart failure of New York Heart
             Association Class 3 or 4, angina not well controlled by medication, or myocardial
             infarction within 6 months).

          7. ECG demonstrating clinically significant arrhythmias (Note:  subjects with chronic
             atrial arrhythmia, ie, atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal supraventricular
             tachycardia, are eligible). A clinically significant ECG abnormality, including a
             marked prolonged QT/QTc interval (eg, a repeated demonstration of a QTc interval of
             greater than 500 ms).

          8. Have known intolerance to the Test Article (ie, documented hypersensitivity AE to
             prior monoclonal antibody therapy, or to amatuximab or any of its excipients).

          9. Have any medical or other condition that in the opinion of the investigator(s) would
             preclude the subject's participation in a clinical study.

         10. Are scheduled for debulking surgery during the study.

         11. Are currently enrolled in another clinical study or used any investigational drug or
             device within 30 days (or 5 x the half-life of the investigational drug/device,
             whichever is longer) preceding informed consent.
