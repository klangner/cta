    <textblock>
      Open label, single-arm phase II study of avastin combined with fluorouracil, doxorubicin and
      streptozocin administered in 28-day cycles. Treatment will continue until progression of
      disease, or until withdrawal due to toxicity, or up to a maximum of 12 cycles (48 weeks). In
      order to reduce the risk of cardiac toxicity, doxorubicin will be administered for a maximum
      of 8 cycles. If disease has not progressed after 12 cycles of treatment, avastin monotherapy
      will continue until disease progression or withdrawal due to toxicity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will need to come for 24 study visits in all. Most study visits will take about 2
      hours.  At some of these study visits, the doctor

        -  Will do a physical exam

        -  Will take blood for routine lab tests

        -  Will do a urinalysis

        -  Will administer study medication Some study visits may be longer because patient will
           have a CT scan or an MRI.

      At patient's last visit, they will have a CT scan or MRI.

      After treatment starts, patient will:

        -  Have their blood pressure monitored with every dose of Avastin® (about every 2 weeks).

        -  Have a history and physical with every chemotherapy cycle (about every 4 weeks).

        -  Have their blood taken for routine blood tests with every chemotherapy cycle (about
           every 4 weeks).

        -  Have a CT scan or MRI during every other cycle (about every 8 weeks).

        -  Have a MUGA scan during every 4 cycles (about 16 weeks).

        -  Have blood taken for tumor markers during every cycle only if their markers were high
           at baseline.

        -  Patients will receive study medication to treat their cancer:

        -  Fluorouracil on days 1 through 5 of each cycle through cycle 12

        -  Doxorubicin on day 1 of each cycle through cycle 8

        -  Streptozocin on days 1 through 5 of each cycle through cycle 12

        -  Avastin® on days 1 and 15 of each cycle through cycle 12
