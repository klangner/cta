  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine cancer is an unusual disease and often goes undetected by routine imaging.
      The 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scan is a new generation of scans that might have improved sensitivity
      and resolution specifically for neuroendocrine tumors.  The investigators will scan people
      with this cancer and compare it to other conventional imaging methods to see if it improves
      patient care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Known diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumor

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Able to provide informed consent

          -  Karnofsky score greater than 50

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening/baseline

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serum creatinine &gt;3.0 mg/dL (270 Î¼M/L)

          -  Hepatic enzyme levels more than 5 times upper limit of normal.

          -  Known severe allergy or hypersensitivity to IV radiographic contrast.

          -  Use of any other investigational product or device within 30 days prior to
             dosing, or known requirement for any other investigational agent prior to completion
             of all scheduled study assessments.

          -  Patients with a body weight of 400 pounds or more or not able to enter the bore of
             the PET/CT scanner due to BMI, because of the compromise in image quality with CT,
             PET/CT and MRI that will result.

          -  Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (e.g. cough, severe arthritis,
             etc.).

          -  Inability to complete the needed investigational and standard-of-care imaging
             examinations due to other reasons (severe claustrophobia, radiation phobia, etc.)

          -  Recognized concurrent active infection

          -  Any additional medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere
             with study compliance.
