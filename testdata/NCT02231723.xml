      This is an open label, multi-center, single arm, dose-escalation study of BBI608
      administered in combination with Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel. A study cycle will consist
      of daily and continuous oral administration of BBI608 for four weeks (28 days) in
      combination with Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel. Combination treatment will continue in 28
      day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or another discontinuation
      criterion is met.

             study requirements.
