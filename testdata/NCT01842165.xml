      The purpose of this study is to determine if 68Gallium-octreotate and 18Fluorodesoxyglucose
      uptake, apparent diffusion coefficient and post 177Lu-octreotate SPECT/CT dosimetry are
      reliable predictors for lesion-by-lesion treatment outcome.

      This is a feasibility study evaluating the use of 177Lutetium-octreotate in the treatment of
      advanced refractory Neuroendocrine Tumors.

      Objectives of the study:

        1. primary (on a lesion basis): To assess the value of the following parameters (obtained
           through functional and molecular imaging) for predicting the lesion-by-lesion PRRT
           treatment outcome:

             -  18FDG uptake on 18FDG PET/CT

             -  68Ga-octreotate uptake on 68Ga-octreotate PET/CT

             -  Apparent diffusion coefficient on diffusion weighted MRI (for these 3 parameters,
                absolute values at baseline and after each cycle will be assessed, as well as
                their relative differences)

             -  Tumor dosimetry on post 177Lu-octreotate SPECT/CT after each cycle.

        2. secondary (on a patient basis): To generate a patient-based response model based on the
           aforementioned parameters.

      Treatment will consist of 177Lu-octreotate injections in fixed activities of 7,4
      GigaBecqurel each, given 11-13 weeks apart, injected intravenously with simultaneous
      infusion of an amino acid solution. (Before amino acid nephroprotection, ondansetron,
      methylprednisolone and metoclopramid, are given intravenously in order to prevent nausea or
      vomiting). Approximately 30 min after the beginning of the amino acid solution,
      177Lu-octreotate is co-infused over 15-30 minutes. The amino acid infusion is continued at
      the same rate for 3-5 more hours (total infusion lasts 4-6 hours).

      In total, 4 cycles are planned. However, the total number of administered cycles will be
      limited by critical organ (kidneys and bone marrow) cumulated absorbed doses.

      Treatment efficacy will be assessed:

        -  on a lesion-basis (change of longest transversal diameter).

        -  on a patient-basis using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors  (RECIST) 1.1.
