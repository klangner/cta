  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well pazopanib works in treating
      patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Pazopanib may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the
      tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effect of pazopanib hydrochloride on the proportion of patients with
      malignant pleural mesothelioma who are progression-free at 6 months based on the RECIST
      criteria.

      II. Determine the clinical toxicities of this drug in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective tumor response status in these patients as measured by the RECIST
      criteria or the modified RECIST criteria.

      II. Determine the response rate in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the
      effect of this drug on overall survival and time to progression in these patients.

      IV. Assess predictive markers of activity of this drug in these patients. V. Assess
      serologic markers of target inhibition by this drug in these patients.

      VI. Determine the clinical toxicities of this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood is collected at baseline and prior to each course of therapy and analyzed for markers
      of angiogenesis.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months.
