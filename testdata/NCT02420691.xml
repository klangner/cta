      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will take LEE011
      capsules by mouth 1 time on Days 1-21 of each cycle. Participant will take LEE011 capsules
      whole, at about the same time each morning, with or without food, with at least 1 cup (8
      ounces) of water. Participant should not chew or open the capsules unless a member of the
      study staff tells them to do so.

      If participant forgets to take their dose, they can still take the study drug up to 12 hours
      later. If participant is more than 12 hours late, they should wait until their next
      scheduled dose. If participant vomits after taking a dose, they should not take an extra
      dose. Participant should tell the study doctor or nurse if they vomit after taking LEE011.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Participant will have an EKG and about 2 hours after their dose of LEE011.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 1:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Participant will have an EKG before their dose of LEE011.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Participant will have an EKG before their dose of LEE011.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If participant is taking
           drugs to prevent blood clots, this blood draw will also be used to check how well their
           blood clots.

        -  Participant will have an image-guided tumor biopsy for PD testing.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 2, participant will have an EKG before and about 2 hours after their dose
      of LEE011.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3 and beyond:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Participant will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.  If participant is taking
           drugs to prevent blood clots, this blood draw will also be used to check how well their
           blood clots.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2, Day 1 of Cycle 4, and then every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 7, 10, 13,
      and so on), blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for tumor marker testing. If the study
      doctor thinks it is needed, participant may have this blood draw performed more frequently.
      The study doctor will discuss this with participant.

      Every 3 cycles (Cycles 3, 6, 9, and so on), participant will have an MRI, CT, and/or
      Octreoscan to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Treatment:

      Participant may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in
      their best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the
      disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study
      directions.

      Patient's participation on this study will be over after the end-of-treatment visit, unless
      they have side effects.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 28 days after participant's last dose of study drug:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Participant will have an EKG and either an ECHO or a MUGA scan.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. If
           participant is taking drugs to prevent blood clots, this blood draw will also be used
           to check how well their blood clots.

      If participant has any side effects or symptoms, they will either be called by a member of
      the study staff or asked to come into the clinic until the side effects or symptoms are gone
      or become stable. If participant is called, each call should last about 10 minutes.

      This is an investigational study.  LEE011 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It
      is currently being used for research purposes. The study doctor can explain how the study
      drug is designed to work.

      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

    <description>Overall response is best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). Participant's response assignment depends on achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  Progressive disease (PD) defined as appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.  Response and progression evaluated  using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (per version 1.1).</description>

    <description>Clinic benefit rate defined as complete response plus partial response plus stable disease with LEE011 among patients with advanced foregut NETs.  Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response (PR) nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed low or intermediate grade, unresectable
             well differentiated foregut neuroendocrine tumors (thymic, bronchopulmonary, gastric,
             duodenal and pancreatic). Patients with multiple neuroendocrine tumors associated
             with MEN1 syndrome will be eligible.

          2. Patients must have radiographically measurable disease.

          3. Pancreatic neuroendocrine patients must have had progression after prior therapy with
             everolimus. Patients with other foregut neuroendocrine tumors must have had
             progressive disease over the last 12 months, irrespective of prior therapy. Patients
             with both functional (who may continue somatostatin analogues as required for control
             of related symptoms) and non-functional tumors are eligible. In patients who have
             previously received therapy, the number of prior lines of therapy should not be more
             than 2 lines of systemic therapy not including somatostatin analogues.

          4. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to any screening procedures.

          5. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          6. Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
             0 - 1.

          7. A sufficient interval must have elapsed between the last dose of prior anti-cancer
             therapy (including cytotoxic and biological therapies and major surgery) and
             enrollment, to allow the effects of prior therapy to have abated: a) Cytotoxic or
             targeted chemotherapy: greater than or equal to the duration of the cycle of the most
             recent treatment regimen (a minimum of 3 weeks for all regimens, except 6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas and mitomycin-C). b) Biologic therapy (e.g., antibodies): greater than
             or equal to 4 weeks.

          8. Patients must have adequate organ function, as defined by the following parameters:
             a. Bone marrow: Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x
             10^9/L; Hemoglobin (Hgb) greater than or equal to 9 g/dL; Platelets greater than or
             equal to 100 x 10^9/L. b. Hepatic function: Serum total bilirubin less than or equal
             to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum
             glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and ALT (SGPT) less than or equal to 3 x
             ULN, except in patients with tumor involvement of the liver who must have AST and ALT
             less than or equal to 5 x ULN. c. Renal function: Serum creatinine less than or equal
             to 1.5 x ULN or 24-hour clearance greater than or equal to 50 mL/min; Serum
             potassium, magnesium and calcium must be within clinically relevant limits (e.g., a
             patient can be enrolled if a lab value may be outside the normal laboratory range but
             the abnormality is not clinically relevant or can be repleted.)

          9. Negative pregnancy test (serum B-HCG) within 7 days of starting study treatment is
             required in women of childbearing potential. B-HCG may be secreted by a small
             percentage of NETs and be a tumor marker. Thus, NET patients with positive B-HCG are
             eligible if pregnancy can be excluded by vaginal ultrasound or lack of expected
             doubling of B-HCG.

         10. Patients not on anticoagulation must have INR less than or equal to 1.5. Patients on
             full-dose anticoagulation (warfarin or low molecular weight heparin) are eligible
             provided that both of the following criteria are met: a) The patient has an in-range
             INR (less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN) on a stable (no change in the prior 2 weeks)
             dose of oral anticoagulant or on a stable (no change in the prior 2 weeks) dose of
             low molecular weight heparin. b) The patient has no active bleeding or known
             pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding such as varices.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a known hypersensitivity to LEE011 or any of its excipients.

          2. Patients with known or suspected brain metastases. However, if radiation therapy
             and/or surgery has been completed and serial evaluation by CT (with contrast
             enhancement) or MRI over a minimum of 3 months demonstrates the disease to be stable
             and if the patient remains asymptomatic, then the patient may be enrolled. Such
             patients must have no need for treatment with steroids or anti-epileptic medications.

          3. Patients with concurrent malignancies or malignancies within 3 years prior to
             starting study drug (with the exception of tumors common to a single genetic cancer

          6. Patient has any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that
             would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate patient participation in the
             clinical study (e.g. chronic pancreatitis, chronic active hepatitis, etc.).

          7. Patient who has received radiotherapy within less than or equal to 4 weeks or limited
             field radiation for palliation within less than or equal to 2 weeks prior to starting

             consent.

         16. Pregnant or lactating women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female
             after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG
             laboratory test (greater than 5 mIU/mL).

         17. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physically capable of becoming
             pregnant, unless they are using effective methods of contraception during dosing of

             and their male partners) during study treatment and for 30 days after the last dose
             of study medication. Effective contraception methods include: (i) Total abstinence
             (when this is in line with the preferred and the usual lifestyle of the subject).
             Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception (ii) Female
             sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy)
             or tubal ligation at least six weeks before starting study drug. In case of
             oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed
             by hormone level assessment.

         18. (continued from above) (iii) Male partner sterilization (at least 6 months prior to
             screening). For female patients, the vasectomized male partner should be the female

             forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for
             example hormone vagina ring or transdermal hormone contraception. In case of oral
             contraception, female patients should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum
             of 3 months before taking study drug b. placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or
             intrauterine system (IUS) c. barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive
             cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
             suppository.

         19. Fertile males who are unwilling to use contraception. Fertile males must use condom
             with spermicide (double barrier method). Effective contraception, as defined above,
             must be used by both sexes (male patients and their female partners) during study
             treatment and for 30 days after the last dose of study medication. A condom is
             required to be used by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the study
             drug via seminal fluid.

         20. Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.
