    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of romidepsin in treating patients
      with lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or solid tumors with liver dysfunction.
      Romidepsin may stop the growth of cancer cells by entering the cancer cells and by blocking
      the activity of proteins that are important for the cancer's growth and survival.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the safety and tolerability of romidepsin given on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28
      day cycle to patients with varying degrees of liver dysfunction (mild, moderate and severe).

      II. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and appropriate dosing recommendations for
      romidepsin in such patients.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of romidepsin in patients with varying
      degrees of liver dysfunction.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore correlations of the Child-Pugh classification of liver dysfunction with the
      observed toxicities and plasma PK of romidepsin administration.

      II. To document any preliminary evidence of antitumor activity at tolerable doses of
      romidepsin in patients with varying degrees of liver dysfunction.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive romidepsin intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

    <description>In order to define levels of hepatic impairment at which dose modifications of romidepsin are required, data will be combined across hepatic dysfunction groups to evaluate the association between toxicity, dose, and liver assay level(s). The outcome variable, drug tolerance and dose-limiting toxicities will be modeled as function of dose and liver assay using multivariate linear regression. Higher order terms of the predictor variables and interactions will be included if there is evidence of non-linear and/or non-additive associations.</description>

             radiologically or clinically evaluable disease that is metastatic, unresectable,
             progressive, or recurrent, and for which standard curative measures do not exist or
             are no longer effective

               -  Patients with a liver mass, raised alpha-fetoprotein level (&gt;= 500 ng/mL) and
                  positive serology for hepatitis, consistent with a diagnosis of hepatocellular
                  carcinoma will be eligible without the need for pathologic confirmation of the
                  diagnosis

               -  Patients with prostate cancer, renal cell cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, lung
                  cancer, colorectal cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, glioma and thyroid cancer are
                  excluded in the normal and mild cohorts due to a lack of efficacy in these tumor
                  types in phase 2 studies; patients with breast, pancreatic, bladder, head and
                  neck cancers, as well as melanoma and other malignancies are eligible

               -  Note: patients with prostate cancer, renal cell cancer, lung cancer, colorectal
                  cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, glioma and thyroid cancer are allowed to enroll
                  in the moderate and severe cohorts provided the patients:

                    -  Sign a separate consent form which outlines the lack of efficacy observed
                       in prior studies

                    -  Are consented to the study by a protocol-specified designee who is not
                       their longitudinal oncologist; patients with neuroendocrine tumors are
                       still excluded from the moderate and severe cohorts

               -  Note: as romidepsin is approved for patients with relapsed or refractory
                  peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) or cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), these
                  patients would be eligible WITHOUT the requirement of having 'relapsed within 6
                  months of last treatment'

          -  Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL (transfusions and/or erythropoietin are permitted)

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L (or platelet count &gt;= 30 × 10^9 cells/L in patients with
             lymphoma or CLL if bone marrow disease involvement is documented)

          -  Creatinine =&lt; twice upper limit institutional normal

          -  Patients with abnormal liver function will be eligible and will be grouped according
             to the criteria below

               -  Group A (normal hepatic function)

                    -  Bilirubin =&lt; upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase
                       (AST) =&lt; ULN

               -  Group B (mild hepatic dysfunction)

                    -  B1: bilirubin =&lt; ULN and AST &gt; ULN

                    -  B2: bilirubin &gt; ULN but =&lt; 1.5 x ULN and any AST

               -  Group C (moderate hepatic dysfunction)

                    -  Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN to =&lt; 3 x ULN and any AST

               -  Group D (severe hepatic dysfunction)

             protocol; patients on enzyme inducing anticonvulsants are not eligible; note that
             patients should have had their steroids tapered to low dose (i.e. &lt; 1.5 mg of
             dexamethasone/day) due to the potential for higher dexamethasone doses to induce
             cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4)

          -  Patients with biliary obstruction for which a stent has been placed are eligible,
             provided the shunt has been in place for at least 10 days prior to the first dose of
             romidepsin and the liver function has stabilized; two measurements at least 2 days
             apart that put the patient in the same hepatic dysfunction stratum will be accepted
             as evidence of stable hepatic function; there should be no evidence of biliary sepsis

          -  Eligibility of patients receiving any medications or substances known to affect or
             with the potential to affect the activity or PK of romidepsin will be determined
             following review of their case by the site principal investigator

               -  Patients treated with any of the medications prohibited must discontinue their
                  use at least 7 days prior to the first dose of romidepsin; certain other agents
                  that interact with the CYP3A4 system may be used with caution

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately; note: since romidepsin binds to the estrogen receptor, the
             effectiveness of estrogen containing contraceptives may be reduced

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients who are not receiving: agents
             with the potential for PK interactions with romidepsin or hepatotoxic antiretrovirals
             (nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs]: abacavir, didanosine,
             emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine), dual protease inhibitor
             (PI)-based regimens except low-dose boosting with ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir,
             maraviroc, and nevirapine may be eligible; additionally, the HIV-positive patients
             should have a cluster of differentiation (CD)4 count &gt; 250/mm^3; if the specific
             cause of hepatic dysfunction is unknown, the patient should be worked up for other
             viral causes of hepatitis and their eligibility determined after consultation with
             the principal investigator

          -  Patients who have received prior romidepsin use are eligible

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had (prior to entering the study): major surgery is not permitted
             within 4 weeks of romidepsin administration; anti-cancer therapy including
             chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal (with the exception of hormones for thyroid
             conditions), and other investigational agents will not be allowed within 14 days or
             five (5) half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of romidepsin (6
             weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C); additionally, participants must have
             recovered to less than grade 2 clinically significant adverse effect(s)/toxicity(ies)
             of the previous therapy, with the exception of alopecia, unless approved by the
             principal investigator; biologics or immunotherapy will not be allowed within 28 days
             prior to, or during, romidepsin administration

          -  Patients with prostate cancer, renal cell cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, lung cancer,
             colorectal cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, glioma, and thyroid cancer are excluded in
             the normal and mild cohorts due to a lack of efficacy in these tumor types in phase 2
             studies; patients with prostate cancer, renal cell cancer, lung cancer, colorectal
             cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, glioma and thyroid cancer are allowed to enroll in the
             moderate and severe cohorts only; patients with neuroendocrine tumors are still
             excluded from the moderate and severe cohorts

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to romidepsin, including cyclic tetrapeptide compounds

          -  Concurrent medications associated with a risk of corrected QT interval (QTc)
             prolongation and/or Torsades de Pointes are not allowed within 2 weeks of initiation
             of study treatment; those medications as reported but lacking substantial evidence
             for causing QTc prolongation and Torsades de Pointes will be allowed, although if an
             alternative medication can be substituted, that would be preferable

          -  Thiazolidinedione agents such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are not permitted

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Patients with current evidence of significant cardiovascular disease (New York Heart
             Association class III or IV cardiac disease), symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             dilated/hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction (within the
             past 6 months), unstable angina, unstable arrhythmia or a need for anti-arrhythmic
             therapy (use of medications for rate control for atrial fibrillation is allowed such
             as calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers, if stable medication for at least last
             month prior to initiation of romidepsin treatment and medication not listed as
             causing Torsades de Pointes), or evidence of acute ischemia on electrocardiogram
             (ECG); marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval, e.g., repeated demonstration
             of a QTc interval &gt; 450 msec*; long QT syndrome; the required use of concomitant
             medication that may cause Torsades de Pointes or may cause a significant prolongation
             of the QTc

               -  Note: due to difficulties assessing QTc in patients with heart block, they may
                  be eligible if deemed safe by a cardiologist

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with this drug

          -  Warfarin is not permitted
