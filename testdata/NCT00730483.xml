      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Infusing doxorubicin beads into the liver, and blocking blood flow to the tumor, may keep
      doxorubicin near the tumor and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects of doxorubicin beads and to see
      how well they work in treating patients with unresectable liver metastases from
      neuroendocrine tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To gather preliminary data and determine the feasibility of a randomized study of
           patients with unresectable hepatic neuroendocrine metastases using PVA microporous
           hydrospheres/doxorubicin hydrochloride.

      OUTLINE: A catheter is placed into the right or left hepatic artery. Patients with unifocal
      tumors will have the catheter or microcatheter placed more selectively into the 2nd or 3rd
      order branch off the right or left hepatic artery in closer proximity to the tumor. PVA
      microporous hydrospheres/doxorubicin hydrochloride mixture is injected into the delivery
      area.

      Patients with less than 75% necrosis at 1 month undergo a second (and possibly a third a
      month later) chemoembolization.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 month, every 2 months for 1
      year, and then every 3 months for 1 year.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of hepatic neuroendocrine metastases not suitable for radical therapies
             (e.g., resection or liver transplantation)

               -  Tumors are hypervascular based on visual estimation by investigator

          -  Predominant to the liver disease, but extrahepatic disease is not an exclusion

               -  No predominant extrahepatic liver disease

               -  No significant life-threatening extrahepatic disease, in the judgment of the
                  physician

          -  Recent-interval progression of hepatic liver metastases

          -  No diffuse hepatic neuroendocrine metastases defined as massive ill-defined tumor
             involvement measuring &gt; 90% tumor burden

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Clinically evident ascites (a radiographic finding of trace ascites on imaging is
             acceptable)

          -  Complete occlusion of the entire portal venous system

          -  Evidence of cirrhosis or portal hypertension

             decompensation
