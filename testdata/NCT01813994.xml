    <textblock>
      Statins are commonly used as cholesterol-lowering medications and have shown effectiveness
      in the primary and secondary prevention of heart attack and stroke. In addition, several
      recent studies of human cancer cell lines and animal tumor models indicate that statins may
      have chemopreventive properties through the arresting of cell-cycle progression. The
      chemopreventive effect of statins was demonstrated in some kind of human tumors including
      colorectal cancer. In addition, recent one large epidemiologic study showed that statins
      decreased risk of gastric cancer. On the other hands, it has been well known that
      Helicobacter pylori infection induces gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia, which are
      premalignant lesions of gastric cancer. Progression of these premalignant lesions could be
      limited by H. pylori eradication. In addition, a recent double blind randomization study
      revealed that simvastatin as adjuvant to standard therapy improves significantly the H.
      pylori eradication rate. Therefore, investigators conjecture that statins may have an
      adjuvant role for inhibition of gastric carcinogenesis. investigators aim to evaluate the
      role of statins in gastric carcinogenesis by observing the changes of gastric inflammation
      under statins.
