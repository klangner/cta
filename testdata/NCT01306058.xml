      Background:

      Sorafenib is a drug that has been approved to treat kidney and liver cancer (hepatocellular
      carcinoma, or HCC) and has been shown to prolong survival in patients with HCC. It works by
      slowing the spread of cancer cells, but it does not fully prevent the cancer from growing
      again. Researchers are interested in combining sorafenib with the experimental drug TRC105,
      which has been designed to block the growth of blood vessels that lead to tumor growth, in
      order to determine whether this drug combination stops tumor growth and reduces tumor size
      better than sorafenib alone.

      Objectives:

      To determine the safety and effectiveness of the combination of sorafenib and TRC105 as a
      treatment for hepatocellular cancer that has not responded to other treatments.

      Eligibility:

      Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with hepatocellular cancer that
      has not responded to other treatments, and who are not considered to be candidates for liver
      transplantation. Patients cannot be receiving anticoagulant therapy with the exception of
      low dose aspirin. No history of bleeding problems or peptic ulcer disease.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a full  medical history and physical examination, blood
      and urine tests, and tumor imaging studies. Participants will have a tumor biopsy or provide
      previously collected tumor tissue for study. An examination of the esophagus to look for
      problems with blood vessels will be completed in patients with a history of cirrhosis.

      Participants will receive sorafenib tablets twice every day, in the morning and at night,
      with a full glass of water.

      Participants will receive TRC 105 infusions once every two weeks on days 1 and 15 of a 28
      day cycle.

      At each visit during the first cycle, participants will have a physical examination and
      blood tests. Participants will continue to have blood tests and a urine test every cycle to
      monitor the effects of treatment, including tests of kidney function. Participants will have
      imaging studies after every two cycles to evaluate the results of treatment, and may also
      provide tumor samples for study.

      Treatment will continue as long as the tumor does not grow and side effects remain
      tolerable.

      Background:

        -  Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy with a
           median survival of 6-9 months. The SHARP study established sorafenib as a standard
           consideration in this disease and set the bar for future studies of systemic therapy.

        -  TRC105 is a chimeric anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody that binds CD105, a
           transmembrane receptor selectively expressed by proliferating endothelial cells. TRC105
           binds to CD105-expressing endothelial cells and mediates growth inhibition, apoptosis
           and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).

      Objectives:

      Primary:

        -  Phase I: To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TRC105 when given with
           standard-dose sorafenib for HCC.

        -  Phase II:To determine the estimate response rate according to RECIST criteria for the
           combination of TRC105 with sorafenib in HCC.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of HCC.

        -  Childs-Pugh A or B (7 points) cirrhosis is allowed.

        -  Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection,
           radiofrequency ablation, or liver transplantation.

        -  In phase I, prior systemic therapy is allowed.

        -  In phase II, prior systemic therapy for HCC (including sorafenib) is allowed.

        -  No history of bleeding varices in previous 1 year (unless subsequent liver transplant).

        -  No anti-coagulation (except low-dose aspirin).

      Design:

        -  TRC105 will be administered intravenously every two weeks, on days 1 and 15 of each 28
           day cycle. Sorafenib will be self-administered twice daily by mouth.

        -  Phase 1: The first part of this study was a standard 3+3 dose escalation phase I study
           with the primary objective of establishing MTD for TRC105 when given in combination
           with standard-dose sorafenib. Sorafenib is taken orally at a dose of 400 mg twice
           daily. TRC105 is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks. Patients will
           be restaged including imaging studies to assess for response and progression every 8
           weeks. The TRC105 dose was escalated in cohorts of 3 to 6 patients up to a maximum of
           15 mg/kg every two weeks. Intra-patient dose escalation was not allowed.

        -  Phase II: TRC105 will be administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks at the
           recommended phase II dose, 15 mg/kg of TRC105 ever two weeks in combination with
           standard dose sorafenib, defined in phase I. The sample size and interim stopping rule
           will be determined using a Simon optimal two-stage design. The first stage will
           initially enroll 6 evaluable patients, and if 0 of the 6 have a clinical response, then
           no further patients will be accrued. If 1 or more of the first 6 patients has a
           clinical response, then accrual would continue until a total of 23 patients have been
           enrolled. As it may take several weeks to determine if a patient has experienced a
           response, a temporary pause in the accrual may be necessary to ensure that enrollment
           to the second stage is warranted. If there are 1 to 2 clinical responses in 23
           patients, this would be an uninterestingly low response rate. If there were 3 or more
           complete responses in 23 patients (13.0%), this would be sufficiently interesting to
           warrant further study in later trials. Under the null hypothesis (5% response rate),
           the probability of early termination is 73.5%.

             radiotherapy, or major surgery must wait 4 weeks prior to entering the study.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any agents not approved by the FDA within the past 4
             weeks.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse
             events.

          -  Proteinuria, as demonstrated by a 24-hour protein of greater than or equal to 2000
             mg. Urine protein will be screened by urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPC). For UPC
             ratio greater than 1.0, a 24-hour urine protein will need to be obtained and the
             level should be less than 2000 mg for patient enrollment.

             (systolic BP greater than 140, diastolic BP greater than 90), ongoing or active
             systemic infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  No anti-coagulation therapy is allowed with the exception of low-dose aspirin.

          -  No bleeding diathesis.

          -  Patients with a history of bleeding varices in previous 1 year are excluded (unless
             patient has subsequently had a liver transplant. Those with gastric varices or
             varices that are deemed as high risk by the endoscopist should be placed on
             appropriate medical therapy as advised by the gastroenterologist.

          -  History of peptic ulcer disease or gastritis within 6 months of TRC105
             administration, unless patient has received adequate treatment for peptic ulcer
             disease and has evidence of complete resolution documented by EGD. Mild gastritis is
             allowed.

          -  QTc greater than 500 msec

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from this study
             due to the possibility of pharmacokinetic interactions between antiretroviral
             medications and sorafenib or TRC105. HIV positive patients not receiving
             antiretroviral therapy are excluded due to the possibility that sorafenib or TRC105
             may worsen their condition and the likelihood that the underlying condition may
             obscure the attribution of adverse events with respect to sorafenib or TRC105.

          -  History of hypersensitivity reaction to human or mouse antibody products

          -  Patients with a history of familial bleeding disorders

          -  Patients with a history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber- Rendu
             Syndrome).

          -  Pregnancy and breast feeding are exclusion factors. Enrolled patients must agree to
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)
             prior to study entry, the duration of study participation and 3 months after the end
             of the treatment.

          -  Patients with unhealed wounds for more than 30 days.
