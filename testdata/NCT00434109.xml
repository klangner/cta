      The purpose of this study is to decide if a medicine that slows growth of new blood vessels
      can be give after the embolization procedure to prevent or delay new growth of blood vessels
      to tumors.

      This is a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, prospective phase II trial. Sutent
      treatment will be continued until disease progression, or excessive toxicity (as determined
      by treating physician or primary investigator), or until a maximum of eight cycles,
      whichever duration is shorter.

    <description>Kaplan-Meier analysis of PFS. Progression-free survival rate at 12 months after first embolization. PFS was defined as time from start of treatment until disease progression or death as a result of any cause. Response and progression endpoints refer specifically to hepatic metastases. Extrahepatic metastases were included for assessment of response and progression by RECIST version 1.0. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started.</description>

             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and
             in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry
             into this study.
