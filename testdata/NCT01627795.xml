  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant mesothelioma is a rare neoplasm that arises most commonly from the mesothelial
      surfaces of the pleural cavity, occasionally from the peritoneal surface, and rarely from
      the tunica vaginalis or pericardium. It has an extremely poor prognosis with a median
      survival of 4 to 13 months for untreated patients 1 and 6 to 18 months for treated patients,
      regardless of the therapeutic approach.

      The anticancer activity of Oshadi D and Oshadi R treatment was tested in preclinical studies
      and in phase I clinical study. Four metastatic mesothelioma patients are treated for 5 to 12
      months. The Oshadi D and Oshadi R combination treatment was generally well-tolerated with no
      dose-limiting toxicities observed.
