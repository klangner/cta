  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine how successful the chemotherapy regimen of Pemetrexed plus
      cisplatin before surgery is at killing all the tumor so that none is left at the time of
      surgery.  Following surgery, all eligible patients will receive radiation to the chest.  How
      patients respond, whether the cancer returns and if so, where, will also be monitored.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be clinically staged using AJCC/UICC TNM staging criteria. Eligible
             stages:

               1. Patients must be M0

               2. Patients with T1, T2, and T3 disease (without cardiac involvement) are eligible
                  (T status can be established clinically and radiologically or at exploratory
                  thoracotomy without surgical resection

               3. Patients with N0, N1,or N2 disease are eligible

          -  Performance status of 0 to 1 on the ECOG performance status schedule.

          -  No prior systemic chemotherapy and no prior intracavitary cytotoxic drugs or
             immunomodulators, unless given for the purpose of chemical pleurodesis

          -  No previous radiation therapy

          -  Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded if they meet ANY of the following criteria:

          -  Have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not received
             regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry

          -  Have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study
             investigating pemetrexed

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding

          -  Serious concomitant systemic disorders (i.e. active infection) that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient or compromise the
             patient's ability to complete the study

          -  Second active primary malignancy (except in situ carcinoma of the cervix, adequately
             treated non-melanomatous carcinoma of the skin, low grade (Gleason score less than or
             equal to 6), localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate or other malignancy treated at
             least 2 years previously with no evidence of recurrence
