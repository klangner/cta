    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety, symptoms and biomarker response of subjects with
      biopsy-proven well-differentiated, low-to-intermediate-grade, unresectable, or metastatic
      GI-NETs with elevated biochemical markers who have relapsed during or after receiving prior
      standard of care therapies, including octreotide, chemotherapy or targeted therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects enrolled in this GI-NET study (OX4218s) will receive weekly dosing with
      fosbretabulin for up to 3 cycles or approximately 9 weeks.
