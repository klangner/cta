  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to introduce a new therapeutic method of intracavitary chemotherapy (cisplatin)
      combined with a fibrin carrier (Vivostat®) after pleurectomy/decortication or extrapleural
      pneumonectomy in a phase I and IIa study for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma patients by
      evaluation of the safety in a dose-escalating model.

          -  Patient with uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses including ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit the operative
             procedure of P/D / EPP or compliance with study requirements
