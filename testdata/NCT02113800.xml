  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as an open-label, prospective, single arm, multicenter study of
      everolimus in histologically confirmed, neuroendocrine carcinoma G3 /neuroendocrine tumor G3
      after failure of first-line platin-based chemotherapy (open-label pilot study).

      The aim of this study is to provide a second line therapy to patients with any type of
      platinum based first line chemotherapy, to gather data on disease control rate and
      progression free survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As more efficient drugs are urgently needed for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors the
      investigator evaluated phosphorylated Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and effectors in
      a series of NEC G3 at the Charité Center. Everolimus showed antiproliferative effects in
      bronchial NET.

      In a second approach the data of this study should be the basis to generate another study to
      further explore everolimus as maintenance therapy in NEC G3/ NET G3.
