  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This summary will use Panobinostat (LBH589) in patients with neuroendocrine tumors to see
      how the patient's tumor responds to panobinostat. Additionally, this study will examine how
      long it takes neuroendocrine tumor patient's cancer to progress while taking the drug and
      examine the overall survival of patients using panobinostat. Also, the study will examine
      the toxicity and tolerability of panobinostat in the patient population. Finally, this study
      will look at the effect of panobinostat on Notch 1 signaling before and after treatment with
      panobinostat.
