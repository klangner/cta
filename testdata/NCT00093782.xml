    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well CCI-779 works in treating patients with progressive
      metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as CCI-779, work in
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the objective tumor response rate (i.e. partial or complete responses as
      defined by the RECIST criteria) in patients with progressive metastatic neuroendocrine
      tumours given CCI-779.

      II. To assess the stable disease rate and duration, time to progression, median survival
      time, 1-year survival rate and toxicity in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine
      carcinomas given CCI-779.  As of 19 July 2010, overall survival follow-up is to be
      discontinued for the four remaining patients on long term follow-up.  At that point in time,
      these patients had been off-treatment for 3 to 5 years.  Time to progression and median
      survival times will be based on the currently available data.

      III. To measure baseline levels of various elements up- and downstream of the mammalian
      target of rapamycin (mTOR).  Where post-treatment biopsies are available, they will be
      analyzed for suppression of elements in the mTOR pathway as well as for any effect on cell
      cycle progression, apoptosis or anti-angiogenic effects.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) receive 2
      additional courses beyond CR or PR.

      Patients are followed up for survival.

             weeks if last regimen contained BCNU or mitomycin C); for patients who received
             systemic therapy prior to study entry, there must be documented progression of
             measurable disease prior to study entry

             is allowed no less than 6 weeks prior to study entry

          -  Previous radiation therapy is allowed if &gt; 4 weeks have elapsed since delivery of a
             dose likely to have myelotoxic effects (e.g. â‰¥ 3000cGy to fields including
             substantial marrow)

          -  Must be willing and able to undergo tumor biopsy once before and once during
             experimental therapy; patients must have tumor lesions accessible for biopsy for
             correlative studies; in cases where there is a medical contraindication to tumor
             biopsy, exception may be granted upon discussion with the Principal
             Investigator/Chair

          -  The effects of CCI-779 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown; for this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should
             a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents concurrently or within
             4 weeks of study entry

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to CCI-779

          -  Concurrent cancer from another primary site requiring treatment of any kind within
             the past 3 years; curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of
             the cervix are allowed

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because CCI-779 is an inhibitor of mRNA
             translation with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with CCI-779, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with CCI-779

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with CCI-779; appropriate
             studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy
             when indicated
