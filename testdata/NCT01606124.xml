    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well Polyphenon E works in treating patients with high-risk
      of colorectal cancer. Polyphenon E contains ingredients that may prevent or slow colorectal
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether POLYE (Polyphenon E) treatment is associated
      with a significant percent decrease in the number of rectal Aberrant Crypt Foci (ACF) (%
      change in ACF) identified during the pre-intervention and post-intervention chromoendoscopy
      exams.  SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the relative tolerability and safety of
      treatment with 2 capsules of POLYE taken twice a day by mouth (Note: each capsule of
      Polyphenon E contains approximately 200 mg of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) versus placebo
      administered for 6 months.  TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the effect of the study
      drug vs. placebo on EGCG levels in plasma and to correlate EGCG levels with drug compliance
      and toxicity. II. To characterize ACF based on four criteria and correlate such
      characterizations with the intervention (vs placebo), as well as exploring the natural
      history of ACF over 6 months in persons at high risk for colorectal cancer randomized to
      placebo. III. To correlate the 6-month measurements of ACF size (e.g., number of
      crypts/ACF), number, morphology, and histopathology with the adenoma recurrence data at the
      next surveillance endoscopy. IV. To assess caffeine and black tea consumption via a Beverage
      Consumption Questionnaire and correlate with study endpoints. V. To assess the effects of
      POLYE versus placebo on a focused panel of tissue biomarkers using re- and post-intervention
      biopsy samples obtained from ACF and normal-appearing rectal mucosa. Residual tissue will be
      stored for further analysis. VI. To study the association of clinical (toxicity and/or ACF
      response or activity) with the pharmacokinetic parameters, and/or biologic (pharmacodynamic)
      results.  OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.  ARM I: Patients
      receive Polyphenon E orally (PO) twice daily (BID).  ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO
      BID.  Courses in both arms repeat every 28 days for 6 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.  After completion of study treatment, patients are
      followed up for 5 years.
