      The purpose of this study is to study the combination of two anticancer drugs, everolimus
      (RAD001) and lenalidomide in patients whose cancer is no longer responding to standard
      treatment or patients who are unable to tolerate the standard treatment for their cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to study the combination of two anticancer drugs, everolimus
      (RAD001) and lenalidomide in patients whose cancer is no longer responding to standard
      treatment or patients who are unable to tolerate the standard treatment for their cancer.
      The investigators seek to establish the safety of taking these two medications together and
      to determine the appropriate doses of the two drugs when given together as well as identify
      potential side effects when the drugs are administered together.

      Another purpose of this study is to find out if the medication works for the patient's kind
      of cancer and side effects of the combination of RAD001 and lenalidomide by looking at the
      patient's response to the treatment. The investigators want to find out what effects, good
      or bad, the drugs have on the patient's cancer.

      This study will also look at specific substances called biomarkers in the patient's blood
      and in the tumor tissue which are involved in the growth of tumor cells and determine if the
      levels of these biomarkers are related to the patient's response to treatment or development
      of side effects.

      An expansion cohort is currently enrolling patients with adenoidcystic carcinoma,
      neuroendocrine and kidney cancer.

          -  Histologic or cytologic confirmation of a solid malignancy

          -  Age ≥18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form. Because no dosing or
             adverse event data are currently available on the use of everolimus in combination
             with lenalidomide in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this

             radiation

          -  Diagnosed with advanced refractory solid malignancies or intolerant of standard
             therapy for the stage of the disease

          -  All previous cancer therapy, including radiation, hormonal therapy and surgery, must

                  present.

          -  All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist® program, and
             be willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist®.

          -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days prior to
             and again within 24 hours of prescribing lenalidomide (prescriptions must be filled
             within 7 days) and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual
             intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective
             method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before
             she starts taking lenalidomide.  FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing.
             Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they
             have had a successful vasectomy.  See Appendix B: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy
             Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements including signing the informed consent form.

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding females. (Lactating females must agree not to breast feed
             while taking lenalidomide).

          -  Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds
             the ability to interpret data from the study.

          -  Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 28 days of baseline.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide or everolimus (including other rapamycins,

             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with everolimus and or lenalidomide.
             In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated
             with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in this

          -  Patients, who have had a major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks
             of start of study drug, patients who have not recovered from the side effects of any
             major surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia) or patients that may require
             major surgery during the course of the study
