  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well early palliative care integrated with
      standard care works compared with standard care alone in improving the quality of life of
      patients and their family caregivers. Palliative care focuses on improving the quality of
      life for patients with advanced diseases and their family members by providing support for
      relief of physical symptoms, emotional and psychological support, and counseling. Patients
      who receive palliative care along with their regular care at an earlier time in their
      disease may experience fewer emotional and physical issues from their cancer. This may also
      improve the quality of life of family caregivers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be about 400 patients enrolled in this intervention study and there will be about
      300 family caregivers enrolled as well. This study will consist of two study groups as
      previously described. The effects of the early involvement of the palliative care team will
      be compared to the usual approach of receiving care mostly from the cancer treatment team.
      The stratification factors include tumor type (lung vs. esophageal/gastric vs.
      hepatic/biliary/pancreatic) and family care giver participation (yes vs. no). Patients will
      be on this study for as long as they receive care. Institutions must have an outpatient
      palliative care clinic that meets the study site requirements as defined in the protocol.
      Outpatient clinic leadership must include a physician and/or advanced practice nurse board
      certified in palliative care.  The primary and secondary endpoints are described below.

      Primary Endpoint:

      To determine the efficacy of early, integrated palliative care on patient and family
      caregiver reported outcomes in those with newly diagnosed incurable lung or non-colorectal
      gastrointestinal cancer

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  To determine the efficacy of early integrated palliative care on other patient reported
           outcomes

        -  To determine the efficacy of early integrated palliative care on family caregiver
           reported outcomes

        -  To assess the impact of early integrated palliative care on the quality of end-of-life
           care and resource utilization in patients

        -  To determine concordance between patient and family caregiver report of prognosis/
           curability

    <description>Patients receive standard oncology care and early integrated palliative care comprising clinic visits or phone calls (if a clinic visit is not feasible) at least every four weeks. In addition, patients and family care givers will be asked to complete questionnaires about quality-of-life, mood, and their perception of prognosis and treatment goals during regularly scheduled oncology clinical visits at baseline and week 6, 12 and 24. Survival follow up will be every 4 months from week 24 until end-of-life or up to 3 years post-enrollment.</description>

    <description>Patients receive standard oncology care. After enrollment, patients meet with the treating oncologist for the patient's standard treatment visit activities. Over the course of the study, patients and family caregivers will be asked to complete questionnaires about quality-of-life, mood, and their perception of prognosis and treatment goals during regularly scheduled oncology clinical visits at baseline and week 6, 12 and 24. Survival follow up will be every 4 months from week 24 until end-of-life or up to 3 years post-enrollment.</description>
