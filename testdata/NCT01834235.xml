  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase II multi-institution prospective open label study in which up to
      90 subjects with metastatic, locally advanced unresectable or recurrent pancreatic cancer
      who previously received treatment with chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX or FOLFIRINOX-like
      regimen will be enrolled into one of two arms:

      A: NPC-1C with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel or B: gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During Part 1 of the study, the safe and tolerable dose of NPC-1C in combination with
      Gemcitabine will be determined. Upon completion of the phase I study up to 90 patients be
      randomized to one of two arms:

      A:  Patients will receive NPC-1C(NEO-102) infusion at a dose of 1.5mg/kg IV nab-paclitaxel
      (125 mg/m2 as a 30 minute infusion, maximum infusion time not to exceed 40 minutes) followed
      by gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 as a 30 minute infusion) for 3 consecutive weeks (on Day 1, 7 and
      15 ) followed by a week of rest (for a 28 day cycle).

      OR B: Patients will receive on Day 1, 7 and 15 nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2 as a 30 minute
      infusion, maximum infusion time not to exceed 40 minutes) followed by gemcitabine (1000
      mg/m2 as a 30 minute infusion) for 3 consecutive weeks (on Day 1, 7 and 15).
      NPC-1C(NEO-102) infusion at a dose of 1.5mg/kg IV  30 minutes following the completion of
      the gemcitabine on days 1 and 15 of the 28 day cycle.

          -  Men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Have received a second line chemotherapy after progressing on or not tolerating
             treatment with FOLFIRINOX as a first line. Prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant gemcitabine or
             gemcitabine-based radiation will not be counted as first line therapy.

          -  Have received an investigational agent for their pancreatic cancer.

          -  Have known brain metastases.

          -  Have had any major surgery within four weeks of enrollment.

          -  Have any clinically detectable ascites.

          -  Have received Gemcitabine for palliative treatment or progressed while receiving it
             or is within 3 months of completion in the adjuvant setting.

          -  Have uncontrolled concomitant illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or
             active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or
             cardiac arrhythmia.

          -  Have serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the Investigator's
             opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this
             protocol.

          -  Must not have other invasive malignancies within the past 3 years (with the exception
             of non-melanoma skin cancers or non-invasive bladder cancer).

          -  Is pregnant or breast-feeding, since the effects of NPC-1C on the developing human
             fetus and nursing infants are unknown and potentially harmful, women of child-bearing
             potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or double barrier method
             of birth control or complete abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of
             study participation, and for three months after the last dose of investigational
             agent.

          -  Have had any chemotherapy or systemic corticosteroids within 2 weeks of study entry.

          -  Have acquired, hereditary or congenital immunodeficiencies including cellular
             immunodeficiencies, hypogammaglobulinemia and dysgammaglobulinemia.

          -  Have a prior history of a documented hemolytic event.

          -  Have a history of hypersensitivity to human or mouse antibody products.

          -  Have a known history of HIV are excluded due to the possibility that Gemcitabine or
             NPC-1C(NEO-102) may worsen their condition and the likelihood that the underlying
             condition may obscure the attribution of adverse events with respect to Gemcitabine
             or NPC-1C(NEO-102).
