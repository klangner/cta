      This randomized phase II trial studies how well macrogol 3350-based oral osmotic laxative
      (polyethylene glycol 3350) works in preventing cancer in patients at risk of colorectal
      cancer. Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use of
      macrogol 3350-based oral osmotic laxative may stop cancer from growing in patients who are
      at risk of colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 (administered at 8 g or 17 g/day
      for six months) versus placebo on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of PEG 3350 on aberrant crypt foci (ACF) number and to compare
      the reduction in ACF number between the low dose (8 g PEG 3350/day) and higher dose (17 g
      PEG 3350/day) groups.

      II. To determine the effect of PEG 3350 on mucosal epithelial proliferation (marker of
      proliferation Ki-67 [Ki-67]).

      III. To determine the effect of PEG 3350 on mucosal apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3).

      IV. To determine the effect of PEG 3350 on snail family zinc finger 1 (SNAIL) protein
      expression.

      V. To determine the effect of PEG 3350 on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of
      SNAIL and EGFR.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive high-dose macrogol 3350-based oral osmotic laxative orally (PO) once
      daily (QD).

      ARM B: Patients receive low-dose macrogol 3350-based oral osmotic laxative PO QD.

      ARM C: Patients receive placebo (i.e., maltodextrose powder) PO QD.

      In all arms, treatment begins within 6-10 days after colonoscopy and continues for up to 6
      months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.
